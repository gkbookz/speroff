THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION

There is only one marker, menstrual irregularity, that can be used to objectively define and establish what is called the menopausal transition. This irregularity will be perceived by patients as skipped menstrual periods or longer durations (about 40–60 days) between periods.28 There is no universal pattern; each woman will perceive a change that is her own individual characteristic alteration.

The menopause is that point in time when permanent cessation of menstruation occurs following the loss of ovarian activity. Menopause is derived from the Greek words men (month) and pausis (cessation). Climacteric, an older, more general, and less precise term, indicates the period of time when a woman passes from the reproductive stage of life through the menopausal transition and the menopause to the postmenopausal years. Climacteric is from the Greek word for ladder. Perimenopause includes the years prior to the FMP during which menstrual cycles progress from a regular ovulatory and predictable pattern to irregular and increasingly anovulatory cycles to eventual cessation of menses.27

Menstrual cycle length is determined by the rate and qual-ity of follicular growth and development, and it is normal for the cycle to vary in individual women. Informative data come from two seminal longitudinal studies (with very simi-lar results): the study of Vollman of more than 30,000 cycles recorded by 650 women and the study of Treloar of more than 25,000 woman-years in a little over 2,700 women.29,30 The ear-lier observations of Vollman and Treloar that documented a normal evolution in length and variation in menstrual cycles. were subsequently confirmed by Cole et al.31 (Figure 17.7).

Following onset of menarche, there is approximately a 2- to 3-year period of relatively long menstrual cycles at first, and then, there is increasing regularity as cycles shorten to reach the usual reproductive age pattern. In the 40s, cycle length may begin to alter again. The highest inci-dence of anovulatory cycles is under age 20 and over age 40.32,33 At age 25, over 40% of cycles are between 25 and 28 days in length; from 25 to 35, over 60% are between 25 and 28 days. The perfect 28-day cycle is indeed the most com-mon mode, but it totaled only 12.4% of cycles described by Vollman whereby overall, approximately 15% of reproduc-tive age cycles are 28 days in length. Only 0.5% of women experience a cycle less than 21 days long and only 0.9% a cycle greater than 35 days.34 Most women have cycles that last from 24 to 35 days, but at least 20% of women experi-ence irregular cycles.35

When women are in their 40s, anovulation becomes more prevalent, and prior to anovulation, menstrual cycle length increases, beginning 2–8 years before menopause.30 Cycles greater than 40 days in length are quite prevalent in the year before menopause.36 In an Australian longitudinal study, when cycle length exceeded 42 days, menopause predictably followed within 1 or 2 years.37 This period of longer cycles commonly precedes menopause no matter the age when menses cease, whether menopause is early or late.38 The duration of the follicular phase is the major determinant of cycle length.39,40 This menstrual cycle change prior to meno-pause is marked by elevated FSH levels and decreased levels of inhibin but normal levels of LH and slightly elevated lev-els of estradiol.41–47 Importantly, even irregular cycles with long intervals (>50–60 days) can be ovulatory, as many as 25%, and although fecundity is markedly reduced, late perimenopausal women remain at risk for unplanned pregnancy.48

In the average woman, a decline in fertility begins around age 37–38, and menopause follows approximately 13 years later (average age 51). However, in epidemiologic studies, approximately 10% of women in the general popu-lation become menopausal by the age of 45,49,50 while the exact mechanisms underlying spontaneous early menopause (before age 45) remain unclear, and are not generalizable, it is probable that some women are born with a smaller than normal ovarian follicular pool that gets functionally depleted at an earlier age. Menopause occurs when the number of remaining ovarian follicles falls below a critical threshold, about 1,000, regardless of age. Average age of menopause of an Indian woman is 46.2 years, much less than their western counter parts (51 years). A definite rural and urban division was also seen. There was a correlation between the age of menopause and social and economic status, married status, and parity status. 

Contrary to older belief (based on a seminal report by Sherman et al. in 197639), estradiol levels do not gradu-ally wane in the years before the menopause, but remain in the normal range, and even be slightly elevated, until about 1 year before follicular growth and development cease. Sherman et al. conducted a small cross-sectional study wherein serum samples were collected over a single men-strual cycle from eight women, aged 46–56, for the study of reproductive hormones. More recent longitudinal studies of women as they pass through the menopausal transition reveal that estrogen levels do not begin a major decline until about a year before menopause (Figure 17.8).45,51,52 Indeed, women experiencing the menopausal transition actually have higher overall estrogen levels, a response that is logically explained by an increased ovarian follicular reaction in response to the higher circulating FSH levels during this period.53 Variability in estrogen levels is characteristic of the menopausal tran-sition, with greater hormonal variability observed in men-strual cycles that display greater irregularity.54

As noted, most women experience a 2- to 8-year period of time prior to the FMP when the occurrence of anovulation becomes common.30 During this time, ovarian follicles con-tinue their rate of loss until eventually the reservoir is finally depleted.55,56 In a study of human ovaries, the loss that began when the total number of follicles reached approximately 25,000, usually at age 37–38, correlated with a subtle but real increase in FSH and decrease in inhibin levels.57 Aging-related decline in the quantity of ovarian follicles is directly related to the rise in FSH levels that occurs with advanc-ing age; this rise in FSH results from reduced secretion of inhibin, a granulosa cell product that exerts an important negative feedback influence over FSH secretion by the pitu-itary gland. It is possible that both inhibin A and inhibin B may be involved, because luteal phase levels of inhibin A and follicular phase levels of inhibin B decrease with aging and antedate the rise in FSH.58–60 A careful study in Australia, however, indicated that the increase in FSH was correlated only with a decrease in inhibin B, and in response to elevated FSH, estradiol levels increased slightly.51

Decrease in inhibin production by the follicular granulosa cells could reflect either a shrinking number of ovarian follicles, or a reduced functional capacity of the older follicles, or both.61 The observation that preovulatory follicular fluid inhibin concentrations are similar in young and older cycling women suggests that the number of remaining follicles is the most important factor.62

In the late reproductive stage, driven by higher FSH levels, the process of follicular recruitment and development gets accelerated with resulting shortening of the follicular phase. This accelerated pace of follicular development in the late reproductive stage is reflected in higher estradiol levels being attained earlier in the follicular phase, suggesting that higher FSH levels stimulate more rapid follicular development.63 Careful studies indicated that the earlier acute rise in estradiol levels results from advanced follicular development at the beginning of the cycle and earlier selection of the dominant follicle.64,65 Follicular phase and overall cycle length reach their nadir at approximately age 42. Over the subsequent 8–10 years preceding the FMP, average cycle length and variability steadily increase as ovulations become less regular and less frequent.29 The aging-related changes in the endocrine characteristics of the menstrual cycle that result from progressive follicular depletion correlate with a measurable decrease in the ovarian volume and in the number of antral follicles observed by transvaginal ultrasonography during the early follicular phase.66–72

The inverse and tight relationship between FSH and inhibin indicates that inhibin is a sensitive marker of ovarian follicular competence and, in turn, that FSH measure-ment is a reflection of inhibin.42,43 The decrease in inhibin secretion by the ovarian follicles begins early (around age 35), but accelerates after 40 years of age, and parallels the decline in fecundity that occurs with aging (as discussed in Chapter 25). Furthermore, the ineffective ability to achieve suppression of gonadotropins with menopausal hormone therapy is a consequence of the loss of inhibin, and for this reason, FSH levels cannot be used to titrate estrogen dos-age in menopausal women on hormone therapy regimens.

The Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study is a longitudinal assessment of the menopausal transition in a cohort of 629 women initiated in 1992–1993. The initial rise in FSH in these women was modest until 7 years prior to menopause and then accelerated with an even greater increase in the 2 years before menopause, finally reaching a plateau about a year after menopause.73 The major decrease in estradiol levels began about 2 years before menopause.74 Declining levels of inhibin B and AMH reached a low to nondetectable point about 5 years before menopause.75 Although the inhibin B and AMH results are in agree-ment with other reports, an exactness of the timing is limited by the fact that the blood samples were obtained from only 50 women in the study. Furthermore, Depmann et al. also demonstrated that while AMH can help in pre-dicting impending menopause as it relates to aging, this predictability is far from being robust.76 Nevertheless, the Michigan study confirms the validity of AMH as a marker for residual ovarian follicles, a concept that is referred to as ovarian reserve. Unlike inhibin B, AMH is not a partici-pant in the feedback relationship between the ovary and the pituitary gonadotropins, rather AMH, a product of the granulosa cells, and reflects the number of residual follicles awaiting FSH stimulation.77 The variability in these hor-mone measurements from individual to individual, how-ever, precludes the practical use of these biomarkers to predict with accuracy the future date of menopause.76

The transition or perimenopausal years are a time period during which postmenopausal levels of FSH (>20 IU/L) can be seen despite continued menstrual bleeding, while LH levels still remain in the normal range. Occasionally, corpus luteum formation and function occur, and the perimenopausal woman is not safely beyond the risk of an unplanned and unexpected pregnancy until persistently elevated levels of both FSH (25 IU/L) and LH (30 IU/L) can be demonstrated.44 However, even under these circumstances, fluctuations can occur, with a tran-sient period of ovarian failure (reflected in amenorrhea, elevated gonadotropins, and low estradiol levels) followed by spontane-ous resumption of ovarian function for a brief period.43 Because variability is the rule, it would be wise to recommend the use of contraception until the postmenopausal stage is defi-nitely established. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, a woman from the United Kingdom holds the modern record for the oldest spontaneous pregnancy, conceiving when 59 years old and delivering by a cesarean section. Several months of amenorrhea together with a persistently elevated FSH level of 40 IU/L or more are reliable signals that meno-pause is either near or has already happened.78

In the longitudinal Massachusetts Women’s Health Study, women who reported the onset of menstrual irregular-ity were considered to be in the perimenopausal period of life.79 The median age for the onset of this period was 47.5 years. Only 10% of women ceased menstruating abruptly with no period of prolonged irregularity. The menopausal transition from reproductive to postreproductive status was, for most women, approximately 4 years in duration. In the study by Treloar, the average age for entry into the meno-pausal transition was 45.1, and the age range that included 95% of the women was 39–51.49 The mean duration of the menopausal transition was 5.0 years, with a range of 2–8 years (Table 17.3).

Preventive Health Screening of Healthy Perimenopausal Women

The most important contribution a clinician can provide to the perimenopausal woman is the awareness and the knowledge that is required to allow aging women to make timely lifestyle and indicated therapeutic choices. This early educational pro-cess will help to build a solid relationship with patients, a rela-tionship they will want to continue as they age. The following recommendations are derived from our own clinical experience:

• Provide reassurance that reproductive aging is a normal phenomenon and menopause is not a disorder.

• Provide guidance and education to facilitate a patient’s decision-making.

• Provide time and an appropriate location for sensitive and uninterrupted discussions.

• Use educational materials, especially handouts, but also explain them using your own words.

• Involve family members during counseling and educa-tional visits.

• Be accessible. Consider designating a member of your staff as the menopause resource person. Encourage phone calls and emails.

• Be involved in community and hospital educational pro-grams for the public.

• Use an effective, well-trained counselor for patients who need in-depth help in coping with life’s trials and tribulations.

Preventive intervention during the perimenopausal years has three major goals. The overall objective is to demystify reproductive aging and ensure that phases of menopause transition and postmenopause are approached as physiol-ogy and not pathology. The overarching goal is to optimize mental, physical, and social well-being. A specific goal is to detect as early as possible any of the major chronic diseases, including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer, as well as impairments of vision, hearing, and teeth. Finally, the clinician should help symptomatic perimeno-pausal women to smoothly traverse the menopausal period of life. Preventive health care and management of the later reproductive years give clinicians an excellent opportunity to function as a woman’s primary care provider.

Key Points

• Regardless of chronological age,women should undergo annual medical evaluations that should include a thor-ough medical history as well as physical examination.

• Annual visits should include assessment of vitals (blood pressure and pulse), body weight and BMI (body mass index), breast and pelvic examinations, and screening for sexually transmitted infections when appropriate. Thyroid function (TSH) should be assessed in the 40’s and annually beginning at age 60 (as hypothyroidism, discussed in Chapter 20, increases with aging and is more common in women).

• Annual screening mammography should begin at age 40 (discussed in Chapter 16).

• At each visit, appropriate testing is scheduled for spe-cific chronic conditions (including abnormal lipids), indicated immunizations are provided, and counsel-ing covers changing nutritional needs; physical activ-ities; injury prevention; occupational, sexual, marital, and parental problems; urinary function; and use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. Stool hemoccult testing should be performed annually after age 50.

• For low risk individuals without a family history of colon cancer, screening colonoscopy is recom-mended starting at age 50, and then every 10 years through age 75.
