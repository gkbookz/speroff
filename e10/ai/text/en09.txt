cognition.421 A Mayo Clinic study reported the results of a double-blind, randomized, crossover clinical trial to assess the efficacy of black cohosh for the treatment of menopausal hot flushes.358 The dose was 20 mg b.i.d., the dose of the most commonly marketed black cohosh product in the United States. The similarity of the studied product with Remifemin was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography and proton nuclear magnetic resonance analysis. One hundred and thirty-two patients were treated for two 4-week crossover periods. Black cohosh reduced hot flushing scores by 20% in the fourth treatment week compared with 27% in the placebo group, and frequency was reduced 17% on black cohosh and 26% on placebo. A randomized trial in Australia found no difference between placebo and a combination of black cohosh with Chinese herbs.422

**Black cohosh is not estrogenic, and black cohosh has no effect on menopausal symptoms.**

An expert committee of the US Pharmacopoeia concluded that black cohosh may be associated with hepatotoxicity; however, a European review of cases with hepatotoxicity emphasized the difficulty in establishing a cause-effect relationship.423,424 Hepatotoxicity remains a concern, awaiting the accumulation of definitive data.

**Ginkgo Biloba**

Ginkgo biloba is an extract prepared from the leaves of the *Ginkgo biloba* tree. It contains flavonoids and unique terpene lactones. *G. biloba* is a multimillion-dollar herb sold in the United States for the preservation of memory. In vitro studies suggested that ginkgo had antioxidant (from the flavonoids) and antiamyloid (from the lactones) effects. Indeed, the biologic studies provided a rationale for the use of ginkgo to prevent dementia.

A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial comparing *G. biloba* with placebo for the prevention of dementia enrolled 3,069 older individuals (over age 75\) in five academic centers in the United States.425,426 The participants were randomized to b.i.d. doses of 120-mg ginkgo or placebo (45% female in the ginkgo group and 47% female in the placebo group). The ginkgo formulation and dosage were that used in many of the brands sold in the United States. The dementia rate steadily increased in both groups over a 7-year period of follow-up, accumulating 277 (17.9%)

cases in the treatment group and 246 (16.1%) cases in the placebo group. The rate of dementia did not differ between the two groups, nor did the rate of Alzheimer disease. In addition, treatment with *G. biloba* did not produce less cognitive decline in adults with normal cognition or those with mild cognitive impairment. Other randomized trials have failed to demonstrate any beneficial effects on Alzheimer, learning, memory, attention, verbal fluency, or concentration.427,428 Caution is warranted, however, when considering treatment in those with CVD, as it may be proarrhythmic; further studies in those with cardiac disease are needed.429

**The American trial robustly demonstrated that *G. biloba* in the tested and commonly used dose did not delay the onset of dementia or cognitive decline.**425,426 The concept of “delay” is important. A treatment that could delay the onset of dementia by 5 years would reduce the number of dementia cases by 50%. In fact, this clinical trial found a statistically significant increase in the risk for developing dementia with ginkgo treatment in the 25% of participants who had CVD prior to enrollment. However, the authors appropriately urged caution in interpreting this subgroup analysis. **A Cochrane review in 2007 of 35 clinical trials with 4,247 participants concluded that there was no convincing evidence that ginkgo treatment benefited individuals who already had dementia or cognitive impairment.**430

More recently, a 2021 Romanian multicenter noninterventional study analyzed *G. biloba* from a different angle by recruiting patients with mild cognitive impairment to trial a standardized extract called *EGb761*. More than half of their study population were women, and they noted improvement in the Mini-Mental State Examination after 24 months. They noted that in patients with other mental health disorders, there was less of an improvement. Although results are encouraging, important to note that this was not a placebo-controlled study.431

**St. John Wort**

St. John wort has been reported to be comparable to tricyclic antidepressants in treating mild-to-moderate depression, based on eight appropriate trials.432 This is the conclusion of two meta-analyses.433,434 All studies were short term, lasting about 4 to 6 weeks, and with small

numbers. The treatment consisted of a 300-mg plant extract in tablet form, administered t.i.d. However, two large, American 8-week trials found no difference between treatment and placebo.435,436

A small, randomized, placebo-controlled Iranian study published in 2021 observed improvement in VMS and depressive symptoms after 2 months of treatment with *Hypericum perforatum* (St. John wort).437 Despite the potential for benefit for some, St. John wort should be treated with an abundance of caution due to a risk for serious adverse effects. The FDA issued an alert in February 2000 that St. John wort may interact with drugs known to be metabolized by the cytochrome P450 pathway: theophylline, digoxin, immune suppressants, and oral contraceptives.438,439 St. John wort activates an orphan receptor that induces the expression of metabolic enzymes.440 In clinically depressed individuals being treated with prescription antidepressants, manic reactions can result (central serotonergic syndrome).

**Phytoestrogens and Cardiovascular Disease**

The cardiovascular story with phytoestrogens received a large boost in 1995, when a meta-analysis concluded that an intake of an average of 47-g soy protein per day lowered total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.441 This was supported by studies in the monkey indicating that isoflavone increased HDL cholesterol, enhanced vasodilation, and decreased atherosclerosis.442

Only intact soy protein has a beneficial effect on lipids. Separation of the protein component from dietary soy protein loses the effect, as noted early in the processing of soy. This effect depends on the inhibition of cholesterol absorption by the nonisoflavone protein.443,444 The mechanism involves upregulation of the LDL cholesterol receptor and catabolism of LDL cholesterol, leading to an increase in bile excretion. The soy peptide binds bile acids and prevents resorption. Alcohol extraction removes the isoflavones from soy protein and causes a loss of the beneficial effect on atherosclerosis in monkeys.445 Thus, both the isoflavone portion and the protein component are required for a full cardiovascular effect. Non-alcohol-washed soy protein extract has been extensively studied in monkeys. This preparation lowers total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, raises  HDL  cholesterol,446,447  produces  coronary  artery  vasodilation,448

inhibits reduction in coronary flow after collagen induced platelet aggregation and serotonin release,449 and inhibits atherosclerosis but not as robustly as estrogen.442,447

In women, soy protein reduces total and LDL cholesterol and does not affect triglycerides or HDL cholesterol. The ethanol-extracted soy protein also has no effect.450-453 The minimal dose is about 60-mg isoflavones daily, which is present in 25 g soy protein per day.454 LDL cholesterol must be above 130 mg/dL to have an effect. Studies of healthy men and women could detect no effect of phytoestrogens (25- to 80-mg isoflavones per day) on lipids or brachial vasodilation.455-457 In a 12-week study of women with type 2 diabetes mellitus, dietary supplementation of 30-g soy protein (132-mg isoflavones) daily improved insulin resistance and glucose control in addition to lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels.458 Soy intake also prevents LDL cholesterol oxidation in men and women with hyperlipidemia, even when circulating LDL cholesterol levels are unaffected.459 Promensil (red clover extract), in a 10-week study, had no effect on lipids (it only contains isoflavones, no protein) but did improve arterial compliance.460 A randomized, placebo-controlled trial of phytoestrogen examined the effects on progression of cIMT over a 2-year period in healthy early (*n* \= 315, ages 40-55 years) and late (*n* \= 231, ages 60-69) Russian postmenopausal women who were without evidence of CVD at baseline. The rate of cIMT progression was significantly lesser in the older postmenopausal population treated with phytoestrogens compared to placebo, suggesting antiatherosclerosis effects of phytoestrogens, finding that stand in contrast to those of ELITE wherein cardiovascular benefit from oral estradiol was observed only in the younger population of early postmenopausal women461; ELITE is further discussed later in this chapter. The FDA, in October 1999, authorized the use in food labeling of health claims related to the association between soy protein and reduced risk of CHD, “based on the totality of publicly available scientific evidence, soy protein included in a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol may reduce the risk of CHD by lowering blood cholesterol levels.”462

Remember that both protein and isoflavones are needed for a cardiovascular effect. Isoflavones by themselves have no effect on lipids.460,462-464 Proteins without isoflavones have no effect on vasodilation and atherosclerosis.445 The FDA has stated that there is insufficient evidence

to allow them to exclude alcohol-washed products from the health claim, but it makes sense that a combined protein-isoflavone product is best. Even in older women with moderate hypercholesterolemia, a high intake of soy phytoestrogens (purified isoflavones without protein) had no effect on the lipid profile.465 Also remember that there is no effect on the lipids in individuals who already have a normal profile. Even in individuals with high cholesterol levels, the beneficial impact of soy protein intake is modest and likely to have little clinical effect. A 2021 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study analyzed the effect of soy isoflavones **daidzein and genistein** on lipids, high sensitive CRP, and uric acid levels in a cohort of Chinese women (*n* \= 165, ages 30-70 years) with abnormal glucose regulation. At 12 and 24 weeks of intervention, no differences were seen between the intervention and placebo groups on any of the markers of interest.466

Another randomized crossover trial from the United States examined the effects of 8-week treatment with a specific peptide Lunasin that is present in soybeans, on cardiometabolic risk indices including fasting lipids, glucose, and anthropometric measures (body mass index \[BMI\] and waist circumference) in a small aging population (19 females and 12 males, mean age 61 ± 9.9 years). Based on the results of in vitro and animal studies, Lunasin is suggested to possess antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, and hypocholesterolemic properties; hence, cardiometabolic benefit was hypothesized from Lunasin intervention. There were nonsignificant reductions in cardiometabolic risk factors after 8 weeks of treatment with the use of Lunasin.467

It will require appropriate clinical trials to determine how phytoestrogens compare in the cardiovascular system with estrogens and to determine the efficacy, safety, and correct dosage. (Studies thus far recommend a daily intake of 60-g soy protein.) In addition, the intake of sufficient soy to produce a clinical response is not easy; intake is handicapped by gastrointestinal symptoms, a major alteration in diet or the use of an unpalatable supplement, and great variability in plant contents and products (due to processing). A dietary intake to match the isoflavone dose used in the studies on the lipid profile, for example, would require about 1 lb daily of tofu\! In addition, individuals demonstrate great variability in absorption and metabolism. A user-friendly preparation must be developed

that minimizes individual variability in response. **Despite the abovementioned observations, a preventive role for soy intake against CVD remains to be proven.**

**Phytoestrogens and Cognition**

Phytoestrogens upregulate cognition markers and improve memory in rats equally when compared with estrogen.468,469 Soy supplementation has been suggested to improve measurements of memory and attention in postmenopausal women.470,471 On the other hand, the majority of randomized trials detected no effects of soy protein, red clover, or black cohosh on tests of memory, executive function, language, visual perception, cognition, or measures of quality of life.421,457,472,473 On the contrary, there is one human study involving men that showed the opposite effect. In a U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) study that began in 1965, men reported on their tofu consumption.474 Cognition was tested in 1991 to 1993 between the ages 71 and 93\. Higher midlife tofu consumption (two or more servings per week) was associated with poor cognitive test performance, enlargement of ventricles, and low brain weight. **At the present time, there is no role of soy products for cognitive benefit.**

An Australian randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial undertaken in 125 postmenopausal women (mean age 65 ± 7 years) published in 2021 reported on the effects of resveratrol versus placebo on cognitive function (primary outcome) and middle cerebral artery blood flow and cardiometabolic indices (secondary outcomes).475 Participants were randomized to 75 mg *trans*\-resveratrol, a phytoestrogen, or placebo twice daily for 12 months and then crossover to the alternative treatment for another 12 months. A significant 33% improvement in cognitive performance was noted with resveratrol treatment compared to placebo. Furthermore, improvement in verbal memory was observed with resveratrol intervention in women aged 65 years or above compared to those younger than 65 years. In addition, improvements in cerebral blood flow and metabolic indices were also noted following treatment with resveratrol. Overall, the results of this Australian trial suggest that regular supplementation with low-dose resveratrol may offer cognitive and metabolic benefit in postmenopausal women.

**Phytoestrogens and the Breast**

In the parts of the world where soy intake is high, there is a lower incidence of breast, endometrial, and prostate cancers.476 For example, a case-control study concluded that there was a 54% reduced risk of endometrial cancer, and another case-control study indicated a reduction in the risk of breast cancer in women with a high consumption of soy and other legumes.477,478 Daidzein and genistein urinary excretion is lower in Australian women who develop breast cancer.479 High soy and tofu consumption and high urinary excretion of isoflavones have been reported to be associated with a lower risk of breast cancer in Singapore, China, and Australia. There is even a lowered risk of breast cancer in American women consuming a diet rich in isoflavones.478,480-484 These studies have supported the belief that high phytoestrogen intake protects against breast cancer. It is by no means certain, however, that there is a direct effect of soy intake.485 Indeed, a 6-month study of the impact of administered soy protein on breast secretions in premenopausal and postmenopausal women revealed increased breast secretions with the appearance of hyperplastic epithelial cells.486 Epithelial hyperplasia based on cytology in breast secretions was demonstrated in 7 (29.2%) of 24 subjects. Swedish and English cohort studies could not detect a relationship between dietary phytoestrogens and the risk of breast cancer.487,488

Genistein increases epidermal growth factor in immature rat mammary tissue, and it has been hypothesized that earlier exposure to genistein promotes early cell differentiation, leading to breast glands that are more resistant to the development of cancer.489 On the other hand, using the chemically induced rat breast cancer model, no evidence of isoflavone inhibition on tumor development has been detected.490 In the monkey, treated for 6 months, no proliferation was reported in either endometrium or mammary tissue.491,492 A recent meta-analysis of the seven cohort and 17 case-control studies examined dose-response relationships between isoflavones and breast cancer risk and demonstrated a 29% decrease in odds for breast cancer when comparing the highest to the lowest isoflavone intake (summary odds ratio \[OR\] \= 0.71, 95% CI \= 0.72-0.81). A dose threshold for isoflavones was noted such that no benefit was evident at isoflavone doses less than 10 mg/d. In the dose-response meta-analysis of

the cohort studies, an inverse association between isoflavone intake and breast cancer was noted such that a 10 mg/d increase in isoflavone intake was related to nearly a 7% reduction in breast cancer risk (OR \= 0.93, 95% CI \= 0.90-0.96). The authors of this recent meta-analysis concluded that the present evidence demonstrates that dietary isoflavone is helpful in reducing breast cancer risk.493

One hypothesis speculates that phytoestrogens protect the breast by decreasing exposure to the more potent endogenous estrogens. High-dose treatment (100 mg of daidzein plus 100 mg genistein) does lower estradiol and DHEA-S levels in premenopausal women and increases cycle length.494 However, these are extremely high doses. One study reported that treatment with Asian soy foods (\~32-mg isoflavones per day) was associated with a 9.3% significant decrease in luteal serum estradiol levels, but there were no other changes, including follicular phase estradiol, progesterone levels, and SHBG levels, or cycle length.495 Interestingly, the reduction in luteal estradiol was observed only in Asian participants in whom urinary excretion of isoflavones was higher than non-Asians.495 These same investigators reported that a high intake of the soy protein alone (with the isoflavones removed) reduced estradiol and progesterone levels throughout the cycle.496 Other studies have found no effects on estradiol, FSH, LH, or SHBG in premenopausal women497 and, most importantly, no effects on circulating hormones in postmenopausal women.498,499 The lack of an effect on gonadotropin and steroid levels is important, depriving the clinician of a method to assess dosage.

Catechol estrogens (2-hydroxyestrone and 4-hydroxyestrogens) have long been proposed as a metabolite pathway that could be protective or at least antiestrogenic. Hydroxylation in the 2 or 4 position produces inactive metabolites. In one study, eight premenopausal women treated with a soy milk supplement increased their urinary excretion of 2-hydroxyestrone by an average of 47%.500 Another study could detect no change in 2-hydroxyestrogens.497 A study limited to Asian American women also was unable to identify an impact of soy intake on overall estrogen metabolite excretion; however, an increase in catechol estrogens was observed with greater soy intake, balanced by a decrease in 16-hydroxylation.501

In response to soy, no significant increase in nipple aspirate levels of genistein and daidzein could be detected.502 However, an indication of

estrogenic stimulation occurred, as measured by pS2 (a protein upregulated by estrogen) levels, but there was no evidence of an effect on epithelial cell proliferation, ER and PR, apoptosis, or mitosis. Thus, no antiestrogenic effect could be detected, and at best, there was a very weak estrogen effect. In another study, 48 women with normal breasts received a 60-g soy supplement for 14 days, and in these women, lobular epithelial proliferation and PR expression increased, an indication of estrogen stimulation.503 Some argue that the key to a beneficial impact on the breast may be early exposure, and a sudden increase late in life of dietary phytoestrogens may be harmful. On the other hand, a Chinese cohort study of 5,042 breast cancer survivors documented a reduced risk of recurrence and death associated with increasing levels of soy intake, evident among women with either ER-positive or ER-negative disease and among either tamoxifen users or nonusers.504 In an American cohort of 1,954 breast cancer survivors, a 60% greater decrease in breast cancer recurrence was observed in postmenopausal women using tamoxifen comparing the highest level of soy intake with the lowest.505 **Most of the evidence indicates that a high intake of phytoestrogens is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer, including recurrence in breast cancer survivors. It is not known whether this effect is a marker for beneficial metabolic responses to phytoestrogens or whether there is a direct impact on breast tissue. The evidence also indicates that phytoestrogen consumption does not adversely interfere with tamoxifen’s mechanism of action.**

Flushes	Insignificant effect

Coronary heart disease	Weak impact

Bone	No effect

Cognition—Maybe protective	Unknown

Breast	May be protective

Endometrium	No effect

Vagina	No effect

**There is agreement that phytoestrogens have no effects on the uterus or vagina.**352,410,411,463,498,499,506-510 **A beneficial effect on vaginal dryness and dyspareunia cannot be expected; however, the lack of a proliferative stimulus on the endometrium is a wanted consequence of phytoestrogen supplementation** (**Table 22.5**).

**Currently, the recommended intake expected to have some effect on CHD is 50 to 60 mg isoflavones per day, an amount that is in 25 g of soy protein aqueous extract. A beneficial impact on CHD in women with abnormal lipid profiles is to be expected, a consequence of a decrease in total and LDL cholesterol and an increase in vascular reaction, but the actual clinical effect is unknown. Excess intake can cause gastrointestinal upset and flatulence, inhibition of enzymes necessary for the digestion of proteins, possibly obstruction of mineral uptake, and weight gain.**

**The Role of Equol**

Equol is a bacterial metabolite and the only hormonally active metabolite of the soy phytoestrogen, daidzein. It is one of the estrogenic compounds in pregnant mare’s urine, hence its name. At least in vitro, equol stimulates gene transcription with both ERs and with a greater potency than any other isoflavone.511 Equol formation is totally dependent on intestinal microflora; therefore, strictly speaking, it is not a phytoestrogen. To be accurate, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen, a member of the isoflavone family, and exclusively a metabolic product of intestinal bacteria.

The most important observation regarding equol is that 30% to 50% of adults do not produce equol, even when challenged with high doses of soy.512 This is in contrast to nonhuman primates and other animals; all that have been studied produce high levels of equol. Thus, there are two human populations: equol producers and equol nonproducers. The key question is whether equol producers receive greater clinical effects from phytoestrogens than nonequol producers. As noted, thus far, the clinical effects of isoflavones on the bone have not been impressive. In a 2-year randomized trial of postmenopausal women, isoflavone-rich soy milk

increased spinal bone mass in the 45% of the subjects who were equol producers, with essentially no effect in equol nonproducers.513 More profound beneficial effects on the lipid profile have been reported in equol-producing women.512 Therefore, the population destined to receive a benefit from soy intake may be limited to equol producers. Studies need to be repeated, measuring the responses in individuals who are identified as equol producers or equol nonproducers. If the population destined to receive a benefit from soy intake is limited to equol producers, a convenient, inexpensive method must be developed to identify equol production. In addition, it may be possible to convert nonproducers to producers. However, at least one study did not show a difference in cognitive performance between equol producers versus nonproducer, but this same study did show a greater improvement in VMS with equol producers.514

An emerging approach is to administer equol itself. Daidzein yields two forms of equol, the *R*\-equol inactive isomer and *S*\-equol, the active isomer that binds to ER-β. *S*\-Equol has been synthesized, and its administration is effective for the treatment of menopausal symptoms.515 Another alternative is the *S*\-equol supplement made by incubating equol-producing bacteria with soy isoflavones.516,517 *S*\-equol also blocks the activity of dihydrotestosterone, and thus, it has potential to treat androgenic effects, such as acne, hirsutism, male pattern baldness, and prostate cancer.518 At this time, due to the absence of high-quality evidence, testing to differentiate between equal producers versus nonproducers cannot be recommended.

**Estriol**

Interest in estriol can be traced to Lemon’s report in 1975 that estriol limited the growth of breast tumors in the chemical-induced rat tumor model. However, it is usually overlooked that estradiol worked equally well in that model. Estriol treatment of postmenopausal women has no overall effect on lipids and no effect in the prevention of myocardial infarction.519,520 Estriol, without concomitant progestin treatment, does increase the risk of endometrial cancer with the long-term oral use of 1 to 2 mg/d.400 At least two studies have been unable to demonstrate prevention of bone loss with the administration of 2-mg estriol daily.12,13 Moreover, one

case-control study found no reduction in hip fractures with estriol compared with a lower risk with estradiol.520 *There is no evidence indicating any beneficial effects unique to estriol.*

**Transdermal Progesterone**

Transdermal (or percutaneous) compounded progesterone cream has been erroneously promoted to have multiple benefits. In order to achieve widespread effects, absorption must yield adequate blood levels. Two English randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled studies used b.i.d. to 4 times the recommended dose and reported blood levels of about 1 ng/mL, supported by very low urinary pregnanediol levels.521,522 An American study achieved progesterone blood levels of 2 to 3 ng/mL with application twice daily.523 A 1-year Italian study did not measure blood levels but could detect no effects on bone density, lipid profiles, or depression scores.524

These studies indicate very little systemic absorption of progesterone from the cream product (the levels do not reach normal luteal phase concentrations), and there is great variability.

An English randomized clinical trial using transdermal doses of 5, 20, 40, and 60-mg progesterone cream could detect no differences in measures of psychological symptoms, somatic symptoms, and VMS compared with placebo.525 An Australian study of 16, 32, or 64-mg transdermal progesterone cream administered daily could detect no significant absorption and, most importantly, no endometrial response and no effect on flushes, lipids, bone, moods, or sexuality.526,527 Incidentally, this study found salivary progesterone levels to be so variable that they had no meaning. Progesterone cream can produce high salivary levels, without a significant change in serum or urinary levels (the mechanism is unknown).528,529 Red cell levels reflect serum levels and do not indicate preferential transport or sequestration.529 Wild yam creams are marketed as progesterone precursors or “balancing” formulas. Yam contains diosgenin, a plant steroid that can be converted to progesterone in a chemical laboratory but not in the human body. Predictably, a wild yam cream has no effects on a wide range of measurements in postmenopausal women.508 Some do contain progesterone, added by the manufacturer. Creams with less than 0.016% progesterone can

be sold over the counter. There is no evidence to indicate that these preparations produce systemic effects.

Better absorption is provided by progesterone gels, an alcoholic solution with hydroxypropyl methylcellulose and water.509 With a 100-mg dose of a progesterone gel, serum progesterone levels are well into the luteal phase range, but clinical use awaits studies documenting the impact on the endometrium.530

**Clinicians and patients should be aware that transdermal progesterone cream will not reduce hot flashes more than a placebo response, but most importantly, this treatment will not protect the endometrium against the risk of endometrial cancer associated with ET.**

Lastly, for women with VMS, additional nonpharmacologic options include environmental and lifestyle changes. Remaining in a cool environment and weight loss have been shown to decrease the number of hot flushes. Complementary and alternative medicine can also be attempted; however, treatments with dong quai, ginseng, black cohosh, isoflavones (including soy protein), yoga, and acupuncture with placebo treatment.352-362

### **MANAGING BLEEDING DURING MENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY**

With sequential therapy, approximately 80% to 90% of women experience monthly withdrawal bleeding. With continuous, combined estrogen-progestin therapy, one can expect 40% to 60% of patients to experience breakthrough bleeding during the first 6 months of treatment; however, this percentage decreases to 10% to 20% after 1 year.110,111,531 Although this percentage of amenorrhea with continuous, combined therapy is a gratifying accomplishment, the number of women who experience breakthrough bleeding is considerable, and it is a difficult management problem. Indeed, the single most aggravating and worrisome problem with daily, continuous therapy is this breakthrough bleeding.

Why call it breakthrough bleeding? The bleeding experienced by women on continuous, combined therapy is similar to that seen with oral contraceptives. It originates from an endometrium dominated by progestational influence; hence, the endometrium is usually atrophic, and yields little, if anything, to the exploring biopsy instrument. Breakthrough bleeding is due to a progestational effect on vascular strength and integrity, producing a fragility that is prone to breakdown and bleeding. It is helpful to explain to patients that this bleeding represents tissue breakdown as the endometrium adjusts to its new hormonal stimulation. From our experience with oral contraceptives, we have learned to be comfortable with this type of bleeding. We have learned that for most patients, the incidence of breakthrough bleeding with oral contraceptives is greatest in the first few months of treatment and usually disappears in the majority of women. Indeed, this is the same pattern exhibited by postmenopausal women on continuous, combined therapy, and therefore, the most effective management strategy is patient education and support.

It is common for women on a sequential regimen to begin bleeding during progestin administration. The timing of withdrawal bleeding in women on a sequential estrogen-progestin program was suggested as a screening method for biopsy decision-making. In women taking a variety of progestins for 12 days each month, bleeding on or before day 10 after the addition of the progestin was associated with proliferative endometrium. Bleeding beginning on day 11 or later was associated with secretory

endometrium, presumably indicating less need for biopsy.532 But does this correlate with the risk of hyperplasia and cancer? According to a study of

413 postmenopausal women, the day of bleeding did not predict endometrial safety.533 Late regular withdrawal bleeding on a sequential program does not give 100% assurance that there is no hyperplasia and perhaps endometrial cancer. This uncertainty with the sequential program is another reason to turn to the daily, combined method where irregular bleeding and sonographic measurement of increased endometrial thickness provide good indications for endometrial biopsy.

Evaluation of abnormal uterine bleeding in the setting of hormone use is identical to the paradigm discussed earlier in this chapter. The thickness of the postmenopausal endometrium as measured by transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) in postmenopausal women correlates with the presence or absence of pathology. However, the severity of pathologic change does not correlate with the measured thickness.534 Endometrial thickness (the two layers of the anterior and posterior walls in the longitudinal axis) 4 mm or less is highly535 reassuring (negative predictive value \>99%), supported by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and allows conservative management.536-540

It is estimated that 50% to 75% of patients experiencing abnormal uterine bleeding on HT and evaluated by TVUS will eventually require a biopsy.534,538 It seems logical that endometrial thickness by TVUS in patients on a sequential regimen can be affected by day in the treatment cycle, and for that reason, ultrasonography assessment should be obtained toward the end of the progestin phase or at the beginning of the cycle.541,542 An Italian study concluded that endometrial thickness measured soon after withdrawal bleeding in women on a sequential regimen was comparable to thickness in women on a continuous, combined program of estrogen-progestin treatment.543 When a thick endometrium is associated with atrophic endometrium on biopsy, polyps or submucous myomas should be suspected. A thorough curettage can miss such pathology, and either an SHBG or hysteroscopy should be considered the next step as discussed earlier.544 Doppler velocimetry does not improve the accuracy of discriminating between normal and abnormal endometrium.545 **A clinician should not be satisfied with “normal” findings on ultrasonography if a patient has persistent bleeding. The pursuit of abnormal bleeding**

**despite “normal” findings should reduce missed cases of pathology to nearly zero.**546 **In this circumstance, hysteroscopy is recommended.**

There is no effective method supported by clinical studies, or a large experience, of drug alteration or substitution to manage breakthrough bleeding. The breakthrough bleeding rate is only slightly better with a higher dose of progestin (5.0 mg MPA) than with a lower dose (2.5 mg).110,531 Therefore, there is not a strong reason to use the higher dose, thus minimizing side effects. The best approach is to gain time, because most patients will cease bleeding. This means good educational preparation of the patient beforehand and frequent contact to allay anxiety and encourage persistence. Estrogen-progestin combinations that contain a 19-nortestosterone progestin (eg, NETA) demonstrate the same pattern of bleeding, but fewer patients bleed in the first 6 months and the amenorrhea rate by 1 year is higher than with other regimens.547-549

There is a subgroup of patients (10-20% at the end of 1 year) who continue to experience breakthrough bleeding. The closer a patient is to having been bleeding (either to their premenopausal state or to having been on a sequential method with withdrawal bleeding), the more likely that patient will experience breakthrough bleeding. Some clinicians, therefore, prefer to start patients near the menopause on the sequential method and convert to the continuous method some years later. Some patients may choose progestin IUD as a preferred HT strategy. The local release of progestin is effective in suppressing endometrial response and preventing unscheduled bleeding in the long term. The LNG-IUD in menopausal women can be left in place for up to 10 years, a decided advantage.148,550 **A combined estrogen-progestin program, however, will not totally prevent endometrial cancer.**551 **Vigilance on the part of the clinician, however, will detect endometrial cancer at an early stage, a stage that can be treated with excellent results**.
