cardiovascular risk associated with an elevated LDL cholesterol or a low HDL cholesterol.

Keep in mind that low HDL cholesterol levels are a component of the metabolic syndrome related to insulin resistance. The metabolic syndrome is partly a result of heredity but is also strongly influenced by obesity and physical inactivity. In the United States, the overall estimated prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is 24%, higher in women (40% by age 60\) and increasing with age.398 The prevalence increases with increasing body weight, from about 5% in individuals with normal weight to 60% in men and women with obesity, and the prevalence is highest in Mexican Americans and lowest in Blacks.399

**Metabolic Syndrome and Cardiovascular Disease**

**As defined by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the American Heart Association, a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome requires the presence of any three of the following five clinical characteristics**400:

1. **Increased waist circumference (**\>**88 cm for women in the United States)**

2. **Increased blood pressure (**≥**130 mm Hg systolic;** ≥**85 mm Hg diastolic) or receiving medication for hypertension**  
3. **Increased triglycerides (**≥**150 mg/dL) or receiving medication for hypertriglyceridemia**

4. **Decreased HDL cholesterol (**\<**50 mg/dL) or receiving medication for reduced HDL**

5. **Increased fasting glucose (**≥**100 mg/dL) or receiving medication for hyperglycemia**

An increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome during the menopausal transition is correlated with increasing androgen dominance that is also associated with truncal obesity, hypertension, and disorders of lipid/carbohydrate metabolism.401,402 Adiposity of the trunk is a risk factor for CHD in women and is associated with a relatively androgenic hormonal state, as well as hypertension, and disorders of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism 403 Central fat distribution in women is positively correlated with increases in total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol and negatively correlated with HDL cholesterol.404 The atherogenic lipid profile associated with abdominal adiposity is at least partly mediated through an interplay with insulin and estrogen.405 It is worth noting that there is a strong  correlation  between  the  magnitude  of  the  worsening  in

cardiovascular risk factors (lipid and lipoprotein changes, blood pressure, and insulin levels) and the amount of weight gained during the menopausal transition. Thus, weight gain and lowering LDL to less than 100 mg/dL with cholesterol-lowering drugs (statins) in the presence of CHD is an important part of preventive health care.406-409 Attention to weight gain during middle age is one of the most important components of good preventive health care. However, **weight gain at menopause is not just an effect of hormonal changes but rather a reflection of aging-related alterations in metabolism as well as changes in diet and exercise that accompany aging.**406

Current recommendations regarding the optimal cholesterol/lipoprotein profile are more aggressive, urging more intensive treatment aimed at lowering LDL cholesterol levels; in the presence of CHD, the goal is to lower LDL cholesterol to less than 100 mg/dL.407 Cholesterol-lowering drugs, specifically the statin family, have been repeatedly demonstrated in clinical trials to effect a marked reduction in the risk of clinical cardiovascular events in both men and women.408,409

Triglycerides are also an important risk factor for CHD in women but are most commonly encountered in individuals with the metabolic syndrome.407 If the triglyceride level is greater than 400 mg/dL and the HDL cholesterol is less than 50 mg/dL, the risk of heart disease is substantially increased. Patients with an elevated triglyceride level and a positive family history for heart disease most likely have an autosomal dominant disorder classified as familial combined hyperlipidemia. This disorder accounts for most myocardial infarctions in women under 40 years old. Triglyceride levels of 150 to 200 mg/dL are considered borderline elevated. Triglyceride levels can be elevated because of obesity, smoking, and lack of exercise. Weight loss alone can return elevated triglyceride levels to normal.

**Observational studies and clinical trials indicate that the major determinants of blood lipid levels are the same for both sexes**. A diet high in saturated fatty acids and dietary cholesterol unfavorably increases blood lipids. Excess caloric intake and obesity decrease HDL cholesterol and increase total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides. Smoking also decreases HDL cholesterol (and also produces lower estrogen levels and an earlier age at menopause). Genetic defects of receptor-mediated

cholesterol uptake account for only a small percentage of hyperlipidemia in men and women. There is also evidence that men and women who had impaired fetal growth have increased levels of cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in middle age.410 The speculation is that impaired liver growth in utero produces a permanent adverse change in cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism.410 Reduced fetal growth also leads in adulthood to insulin resistance and lower HDL cholesterol levels, most severe in those who become obese.411 **However, obesity or weight gain, tobacco use, and other social risk factors noted at menopause is not an effect of menopausal hormonal changes but rather a reflection of aging-related alterations in lifestyle.**406

**C-Reactive Protein and Cardiovascular Disease**

The immune system (monocytes, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules) and inflammatory processes both play an active role in the process of atherosis.412 Studies indicate that C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of cardiovascular risk in both men and women.413-415 This risk is limited, however, to arterial disease; CRP levels are not linked to venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolus.413 CRP predicts an increased risk of cardiovascular events even in individuals who have normal lipid levels, and, therefore, it is argued that both CRP and lipid profiles should be used for screening purposes.415,416 CRP is a protein synthesized in the liver and atherosclerotic arteries and was given its name because it reacts with the C-polysaccharide of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Thus, the circulating level of CRP increases in response to various inflammatory stimuli but, specifically, bacterial infections and chronic inflammatory conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Sensitive assays now detect small increases associated with low-grade inflammation in the vascular system.

Increased levels of CRP in patients with angina predict poor outcome, an increase in the relative risk of a coronary event. Prospective studies have documented an increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients without known CVD who have high CRP levels, an association that is even greater in smokers.417 Higher mean levels are found in both men and women who subsequently have myocardial infarctions. Stroke and peripheral vascular disease are also increased in men with higher CRP levels, and in women,

CRP is also elevated in stroke.418 In a metaanalysis of 14 prospective studies, individuals with CRP levels in the top third compared with individuals in the bottom third had a 2-fold increase in relative risk for CHD.419 Thus, CRP levels have predictive value in both healthy individuals and individuals with cardiac disease. In addition, statin treatment lowers CRP levels,420 and evidence indicates that statins and aspirin achieve greater benefits in individuals with high CRP levels.413,420,421

In general, studies have indicated that oral estrogen treatment (with or without progestin) increases CRP levels and raloxifene does not. In a double-blind, randomized trial, menopausal hormone therapy and raloxifene equally lowered homocysteine levels (a marker for vascular risk), but estrogen-progestin treatment increased CRP levels, whereas raloxifene had no effect.422 These results were duplicated in a Dutch randomized study.423,424 Tibolone (discussed later in Chapter 22 under the section “Menopausal Hormone Therapy”) increases CRP levels to the same degree as oral estrogen therapy.425 A cross-sectional study found higher levels of CRP in healthy postmenopausal women using hormone therapy.424 In the PEPI randomized trial, hormone therapy increased CRP levels, but the levels of E-selectin, another marker of inflammation, were reduced.426

Estrogen-induced increase in CRP levels may be due to the known stimulant effects of estrogen on hepatic synthesis of proteins, especially because of the first-pass phenomenon with oral administration. For this reason, transdermal estrogen treatment does not change CRP level.425,427,428 Studies on multiple inflammatory markers report that oral estrogen therapy increases only CRP, the only marker synthesized in the liver. In fact, oral hormone therapy, while increasing CRP, reduces the circulating levels of other inflammatory markers (E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-a), with inconsistent effects on interleukin-6 (IL-6).429,430 **Most importantly, it is not certain that the decrease in CRP levels with statins and the increase with estrogen are actually instrumental in clinical outcomes or reflect other effects. Thus, raising or lowering CRP levels will not necessarily increase and decrease the risk of clinical disease. A study from the WHI confirmed the correlation between baseline levels of CRP and an elevated risk of CHD, but the increase in CRP induced by oral hormone therapy did**

**not further increase this risk\!**431 **The uncertainties and questions regarding the clinical relevance of CRP levels make it premature to conclude that changes in CRP levels with hormone therapy have any direct clinical consequence. This does not detract, however, from the utility of CRP levels in quantifying the overall risk of CVD in an individual patient.**

**Lipoprotein(a) and Cardiovascular Disease**

Lp(a) is composed of two parts, a lipoprotein particle that is similar to LDL and a glycoprotein component that resembles a clotting protein. Lp(a) is an independent risk factor for CHD. Menopausal hormone therapy has been associated with a reduction in circulating Lp(a) levels.432 Unlike other markers, the levels of Lp(a) are unaffected by lifestyle, and no clinical use has been established for Lp(a) measurements as a screening tool.

**Sex Steroids and Cardiovascular Disease**

As noted earlier, the leading cause of death among women continues to be CHD. Coronary atherosclerosis is a lifelong process that varies in its slope of development according to the presence or absence of risk factors. The landmark	Pathobiological		Determinants		of		Atherosclerosis	in	Youth (PDAY) study documented the presence of fatty streaks in adolescents and an increasing prevalence with increasing age.433 The PDAY study further established that abnormal lipid profiles early in life are a major factor in determining the extent and age of onset of atherosclerosis.434 It is important for		clinicians		caring	for			women	to		appreciate	the		importance	of premenopausal atherosclerosis and to understand that appropriate medical interventions		can	reduce	the	risk	 of		 later		clinical		events.		Because atherosclerosis begins early in life, it is logical to conclude that the postmenopausal risk of coronary clinical events is influenced by the degree of coronary artery atherosclerosis already present at the time of menopause. Women with POI (older terminology is “premature or primary ovarian failure, or POF”) are at increased risk for CVD.435 In other words, there is an	inverse		relationship		between	the	risk	of		CVD	and the age of menopause.436 Endothelial function in women with POI is impaired, as measured by dilation of the brachial artery in response to blood flow, a

response known to be mediated by estrogen-modulated endothelial nitric oxide.437,438 This association between endothelial dysfunction and hypoestrogenemia is reinforced by the observation that endothelial dysfunction in women with POI was improved by hormone therapy.437

An important contribution to the gender difference in CVD prevalence and age of onset is the favorable effect of estrogen on important endothelial events. Vasodilatory and antithrombotic activities can be attributed to endothelial production of nitric oxide and prostacyclin, a process favorably influenced by estrogen. Hypercholesterolemia adversely affects this important endothelial process, and estrogen protects this important endothelial function in the presence of hypercholesterolemia.439 Estrogen inhibits the oxidation of LDL and also protects against the toxic effects of oxidized LDL on the endothelium. Women in the SWAN study who complained of hot flushing had more evidence of subclinical CVD, such as aortic calcification, compared to those without hot flushes.440

A Chinese comparison study concluded that Chinese men and women with angiographically determined coronary artery disease differ in the circulating sex steroid hormone milieu, compared with age-matched healthy individuals.441 Straightforward reasoning has led investigators to connect the different prevalence of coronary artery disease in men and women to the obvious differences in circulating sex steroids determined by the testicles and ovaries. The newly appreciated importance of estrogen in the premenopausal years has added strength to this connection. For many years, it has generally been believed that higher estrogen exposure in women protects against coronary artery disease and that the difference in coronary artery disease prevalence between men and women diminishes after menopause because of the loss of estrogen. At the heart of the matter is the gonadal difference between men and women.

Acute coronary events in premenopausal women occur more frequently when estrogen levels are the lowest during the menstrual cycle.442 In the national SWAN study, cardiovascular risk factors were more favorable in women with higher levels of estrogen and less favorable in women with longer menstrual cycles.443 This was supported in the WISE (Women’s Ischemia Syndrome Evaluation), a study of premenopausal women undergoing coronary angiography for suspected myocardial infarction, where coronary artery disease was more prevalent in those women who had

low estrogen levels because of hypothalamic suppression.444 These findings are similar to the pioneering studies in monkeys that demonstrated acceleration of atherosclerosis in animals with low estrogen because of stress-induced hypothalamic suppression, an effect that could be prevented by oral contraceptive treatment.445-447 Postmenopausal women studied with coronary angiography in the WISE study who had used oral contraceptives in the past had less coronary artery disease.448 Even amenorrheic athletes in good physical condition have demonstrated endothelial dysfunction, a condition that responded favorably to estrogen-containing oral contraceptives, further highlighting the beneficial impact estrogen has on CVD throughout a woman’s life.449,450

A recent secondary analysis of data from the previously mentioned KEEPS looked at the deposition of fat around the heart and risk for coronary artery disease in relation to both use of and route of hormone therapy compared to placebo. Of 727 recently menopausal women enrolled in the KEEPS RCT, 474 (mean age: 52.7 (SD 2.6)) underwent chest computed tomography-based heart fat quantification at baseline and at 48 months; authors compared association between pericardiac and epicardial adipose tissue (PAT) with coronary artery calcification (CAC) score, a primary endpoint in KEEPS. In comparison to those randomized to placebo, women who received oral CEE over the 48-month duration of KEEPS were significantly less likely to have any increase in PAT (odds ratio was 0.62 \[95% CI, 0.40-0.97\]; *P* \= 0.03). Not only was there no evidence of attenuation in PAT accrual in women receiving transdermal estrogen, but an interaction was also observed between route of hormone therapy and the relationship between changes in PAT and progression in CAC (*P* \= 0.02) such that increases in PAT were associated with CAC increases only in the transdermal 17β-estradiol group.451 This same group, in a separate analysis on the KEEPS cohort, also noted that in contrast to transdermal estradiol, use of oral CEE slowed the progression of atherosclerosis as assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT).452 However, the authors conclude that more research is required to better understand the mechanism that would explain the observed differential in CIMT progression between the two hormone therapy interventions as it is unclear if the beneficial effect resulted from the route of hormone administration or the type of estrogen formulation (CEE vs 17β estradiol).

Depression is a recognized risk factor for heart disease, but its contribution to premenopausal atherosclerosis is just beginning to be appreciated. Premenopausal monkeys that exhibit depressive behavior (induced by their lower social rank in a colony of animals) develop a more adverse lipid profile and an increasing degree of atherosclerosis when fed atherogenic diets.453 Premenopausal women with a history of recurrent depression and without known coronary disease are more likely to have coronary and aortic calcification, a marker for early atherosclerosis.454 The SWAN study found more aortic calcification in Black women with depressive symptoms, although an association between coronary calcification and depression in Black or White women could not be detected.455

Thus, hypoestrogenemia in the premenopausal years, whatever the cause, can increase the progression of atherosclerosis. This would include suppressed ovarian function associated with stress, depression, or intense athletic activity. The progressively deleterious effects of hypoestrogenemia include endothelial dysfunction, lower levels of HDL cholesterol, an increase in central obesity, and possibly depression. **In monkeys and in women, lipid effects account for only 25% to 30% of the atheroprotective effects of estrogens.**456,457

A Chinese comparison study concluded that Chinese men and women with angiographically determined coronary artery disease differ in the circulating sex steroid hormone milieu compared with age-matched healthy individuals.441 Straightforward reasoning has led investigators to connect the different prevalence of coronary artery disease in men and women to the obvious differences in circulating sex steroids determined by the testicles and ovaries. Thus, it is the gonadal difference between men and women that creates the differences in coronary artery disease. The newly appreciated importance of estrogen in the premenopausal years has added strength to this connection and encourages the thought process that estrogen inhibits atherosclerosis by multiple mechanisms.458

A vast literature has documented multiple mechanisms favorably influenced by estrogen that would inhibit the development of atherosclerosis.458 Clinicians tend to view testosterone as an estrogen opponent, and this is supported, for example, by studies such as lipid responses to testosterone that move in opposite directions to those of

estrogen.459 Both beneficial and detrimental vascular actions of testosterone have been described in in vitro and animal studies.

Clinical studies in women have, in general, supported an association between hyperandrogenism and an increased risk for CVD. The lipid and lipoprotein profile in androgenized women with polycystic ovaries (who are also exposed to relatively lower estrogen levels over time) is similar to the male pattern with higher levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol, and lower levels of HDL cholesterol, and this abnormal pattern is independent of body weight.460-465 An adverse lipid and lipoprotein profile is a distinguishing feature of these patients even when body mass index (BMI), insulin, and age are controlled in case-control studies.465 Subclinical atherosclerosis can be demonstrated by carotid ultrasonography to be prevalent in premenopausal women with a history of anovulation and polycystic ovaries.466 In women undergoing coronary angiography, the prevalence of polycystic ovaries is increased, and women with polycystic ovaries have more extensive coronary atherosclerosis.467 In the Nurses’ Health Study, women with very irregular cycles compared to women with regular cycles had an adjusted increased risk of CHD.468 **Thus, anovulatory women with polycystic ovaries develop risk factors for atherosclerosis and ultimately clinical disease comparable with that found in older postmenopausal women.**

Given the variability in circulating sex steroid levels between individuals, between sexes, and within individuals, we should not be surprised that random blood sampling does not always document meaningful differences in blood levels of gonadal steroids in men and women with coronary artery disease. Nevertheless, some cross-sectional and prospective cohort studies have documented lower circulating testosterone levels in men with coronary artery disease and higher levels in men with a reduced risk of metabolic syndrome.469,470 A prospective cohort study determined that lower testosterone levels were associated with an increased risk of developing metabolic syndrome in men.471 Men with heart failure demonstrate improvements in symptoms and functional capacity when treated with testosterone.472

In healthy postmenopausal women, higher androgen levels are associated with increased metabolic markers for the risk of coronary artery disease,  and  increasing  testosterone  levels  during  the  perimenopausal

transition correlated with an increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in the SWAN study.401,473,474 Higher testosterone levels, *although still in the normal range,* have also been found to correlate with a reduction in atherosclerosis progression in naturally postmenopausal women.475,476 **In summary, existing data suggest that higher testosterone levels within the normal physiologic range may be protective against atherosclerosis (perhaps by target tissue aromatization to estrogens), whereas elevated androgen levels above the normal range, such as in anovulatory women with polycystic ovaries, are atherogenic.**

The important studies in women and monkeys reviewed previously indicate that there exists an innate trajectory of atherosis for each individual that can be modulated by various risk factors and that the slope of this process determines the age of onset for clinical events, providing an opportunity for primary prevention.477 The contribution of premenopausal atherosclerosis to the development of clinical events highlights the important role for clinicians in aggressively promoting preventive interventions that can favorably change the slope of progression of atherosclerosis. An important risk factor is exposure to protective levels of estrogen at all stages of life. Conditions associated with hypoestrogenemia during the premenopausal years, therefore, require evaluation and treatment. There are many causes of hypoestrogenemia, and the treatments will vary according to the etiology. When indicated, appropriate hormone treatment can reduce the risk of CVD later in life. In addition, appropriate interventions in insulin-resistant women with the metabolic abnormalities associated with polycystic ovaries can reduce the risks of both CVD and diabetes mellitus.

A logical continuum of this reasoning is that hormone therapy in the perimenopausal and early postmenopausal years may and can offer some level of primary prevention of clinical coronary disease; conversely, initiating hormone therapy for the first time in older women who are well into the postmenopausal period when atherosclerotic processes may have already been initiated may increase their risk for CHD, particularly so in the first year of hormone use.478 **The “timing hypothesis” proposes that adequate estrogen exposure prior to the onset of clinical events provides protection against CVD (discussed in further detail in Chapter 22).** A metaanalysis of 23 randomized hormone therapy trials

concluded that hormone treatment reduced the risk of CHD events in younger women compared with older women (10 or more years since menopause or \>60 years of age).479 This is a conclusion that is less firm now than when first proposed because most of these trials were not designed to measure an endpoint of CVD. However, another metaanalysis by the same authors concluded that hormone therapy reduced overall mortality in women with an average age of less than 60\.480

**Cardiovascular Disease and Vasomotor Symptoms440,478,481-483**

A relationship between severity and frequency of VMS and risk of CVD was observed in the ongoing longitudinal SWAN cohort (Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation). Similar findings were observed in MsHeart/MsBrain studies that objectively affirmed VMS burden and imaging-based evidence of vascular detriment in association with severity of vasomotor burden. These observational studies have identified frequent and severe VMS as a risk for CVD and vascular health. Worsening lipid profile, inflammatory milieu, higher blood pressure indices, and evidence of subclinical CVD have been observed in association with greater vasomotor symptomatology.

**Cardiovascular Disease, Aging, and Menopause: Concluding Thoughts**

In the last 30 years, mortality from CHD has declined substantially in the United States. Improvements in medical and surgical care can account for some of this decline, but 60% to 70% of the improvement is due to timely implementation of preventive measures. Excellent data from epidemiologic studies and clinical trials demonstrate substantial contributions from strategies such as smoking cessation, blood pressure reduction, and lowering of cholesterol toward a documented decline in stroke and heart disease-related morbidity and mortality.484-486 The most effective means to lower CHD in a population is through primary prevention, especially smoking cessation and body weight reduction. While physiologic levels of estrogen are clearly relevant for maintenance of cardiovascular health, however, the impact of exogenous estrogen on cardiovascular risk in aging postmenopausal women who are remote from the FMP is not clearly

delineated and may even be detrimental.487 When attempting to understand the role of estrogens on cardiovascular risk, it is important to distinguish between endogenous and exogenous estrogens. In addition, more recent work has begun assessing the role of additional reproductive hormones (ie, FSH) as well as the relevance of vasomotor instability in itself as predictors of cardiovascular risk.487 While the loss of premenopausal estradiol levels is believed to contribute to the escalation in CVD in postmenopausal years, the bulk of existing clinical data are “associative.” Appropriately designed studies are needed to better understand the spectrum of players (hormonal and nonhormonal) that may be relevant as causative to the processes that result in risk escalation for CVD as women progress along the stages of reproductive aging.487

**Special Patient Populations**

***Human Immunodeficiency Virus and Menopause488-491***

There are accruing data analyzing an interplay between chronic infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) with age at natural menopause and menopausal symptomatology. With improved survivorship secondary to effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV-infected women are increasingly surviving into postmenopausal stage of life. An increasing number of observational studies are showing earlier age at menopause and greater menopausal symptom burden in the HIV-infected populations.488,489 In a 2021 systematic review of eight studies, five showed an earlier age of menopause, between the ages of 46 to 50 versus 47 to 51, in HIV positive versus negative women.490 Additionally, increased rates of POI and early menopause (2.3-35% and 14.6-27.9%, respectively) were noted in HIV-infected populations. However, study flaws were noted such as the lack of an HIV-negative control.490 A correlation between low CD4 counts (\<200 cells/mm3, 200-500 cells/mm3, and \>500 cells/mm3) and decreasing age of FMP has been inconsistently recognized (Imai). Lastly, there are conflicting results concerning a potentially decreased response to antiretroviral treatment with increasing age. The authors noted that these studies did not consider important variables that impact menopause, such as drug use, social/economical/educational factors, and race.488 Additionally, a metaanalysis in 2019 noted a 1.7 increased odds ratio of amenorrhea in

women living with HIV. Given the adverse impacts of hypoestrogenemia on long-term bone, heart, and brain health, this remains a vulnerable population that requires additional care to identify those at risk early in the menopausal journey so as to allow opportunities for timely initiation of preventive strategies toward safeguarding overall health.491

***Primary (or Premature) Ovarian Insufficiency (POI)***

POI is distinct from age-appropriate natural menopause, in that onset of ovarian insufficiency occurs before age 40, and is discussed in detail in Chapter 10\. While the endocrinology and the symptomatology of POI are similar to that of natural menopause, the course and pathophysiology of POI differ from natural menopause in many respects. Ovaries of women with POI demonstrate residual dormant ovarian follicles in a higher density than seen in naturally menopausal women. Unlike natural menopause, episodic resumption of ovarian follicular growth can be seen in up to 10% of women with POI, and spontaneous conceptions have also been described.

***Diminished or Poor Ovarian Reserve492-494—A Distinct Phase in Paradigm of Reproductive Aging?***

Diminished ovarian reserve (DOR) or poor ovarian reserve (POR) is a distinct clinical entity that relates to infertility. Unlike POI, women with DOR or POR are deemed premenopausal in experiencing regular menstrual cycles despite biochemical evidence of impending ovarian insufficiency (elevated FSH and low to undetectable AMH levels). Therefore, based on menstrual cyclicity alone, one would assume that appropriate levels of reproductive hormones are present and thus protective for general well-being, and for skeletal and cardiovascular health, in particular. However, does the reduced oocyte supply impact age at menopause or long-term health risks? One cross-sectional study of 89 premenopausal women with 28 patients with DOR attempted to answer this question by analyzing data on quality of life and bone health. Upregulation of bone turnover markers, lesser bone mass, and an increase in sleep disturbances and sexual dissatisfaction were observed in reproductive age women with DOR compared to those with normal ovarian reserve.492 Others compared cardiovascular risk markers in DOR versus normal ovarian reserve patients

and	identified	worse	cardiovascular	and		metabolic	indices	(insulin resistance; higher CRP, triglyceride, and LDL levels; and lower HDL levels) in women with DOR.493,494 The literature around POR and age at menopause is even more sparse. One small, single site retrospective cohort study saw an increased risk of premature and early menopause (3% vs 0%; 11% vs 3%, respectively) in infertile women who underwent artificial reproductive techniques and who were classified as POR versus those with normal ovarian reserve.495 Although more studies are needed to validate these observations, preliminary data are concerning that women with DOR/POR may represent a subgroup who may be susceptible to early deterioration in aging associated cardiovascular and skeletal indices and may hence be at an exaggerated lifetime risk for skeletal fragility and CVD. In summary, in women, well-defined stages delineate the trajectory of reproductive aging, each with defined norms. Menopause marks an end to the reproductive stage of life. While age-appropriate menopause is a normal phenomenon, this phase of life can be burdensome for some symptomatic women. When menopause is early (before age 45\) or premature (before age 40), or sudden (such as following surgical removal of both ovaries), not only can the symptom burden be more troublesome, but, additionally, these women may be at an exaggerated lifetime risk for chronic disorders such as CVD and osteoporosis. The symptoms frequently seen and related to decreasing	ovarian	follicular	competence	as	women		transition	from premenopause into perimenopause and then postmenopausal stages of life

that is characterized by estrogen loss include:

* Disturbances in menstrual pattern, including anovulation and reduced fertility, AUB, and, ultimately, amenorrhea

* Vasomotor instability (hot flushes and sweats)

* Atrophic conditions: atrophy of the vaginal epithelium; formation of urethral caruncles; dyspareunia and pruritus due to vulvar, introital, and vaginal atrophy; general skin atrophy; and urinary difficulties such as urgency and abacterial urethritis and cystitis

* Health problems secondary to long-term deprivation of estrogen, including osteoporosis and CVD

* There is a lack of knowledge concerning long-term health consequences in special patient populations, such as those with HIV, DOR, and POR.

**Preventive Health Screening of Healthy Perimenopausal Women**

The most important contribution a clinician can provide to the perimenopausal woman is the awareness and the knowledge that is required to allow aging women to make timely lifestyle and indicated therapeutic choices. This early educational process will help to build a solid relationship with patients, a relationship they will want to continue as they age.

### **PERIMENOPAUSE AND MENOPAUSE TIMING AS AN OPPORTUNITY**

Preventive intervention during the perimenopausal and early menopausal years has three major goals. The overall objective is to demystify reproductive aging and ensure that phases of menopause transition and postmenopause are approached as physiology and not pathology. The overarching goal is to optimize mental, physical, and social well-being. A specific goal is to detect as early as possible any of the major chronic diseases, including hypertension, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer, as well as impairments of vision, hearing, and teeth. Finally, the clinician should help symptomatic women to smoothly traverse the menopausal period of life. Preventive health care and management of the later reproductive years give clinicians an excellent opportunity to function as a woman’s primary care provider.
