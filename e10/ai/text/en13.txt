In contrast, the WHI results in the estrogen-progestin arm indicated an earlier appearance of *invasive, lymph node–positive* tumors than previously reported in case-control and cohort studies. The WHI argued that the results (both the invasive breast cancers and the mammography findings) are consistent with stimulation of growth of established breast cancers (supported by no statistical difference in in situ tumors in the WHI trial) but at the same time a delay in diagnosis. This certainly challenges the idea that hormone users have better outcomes because of earlier detection. The WHI suggested that this disagreement could be because of a difference of mammography use in the observational studies. However, as pointed out, even studies that examined tumor characteristics and outcome in users and nonusers who have equally used mammography, lower-grade and lower-stage disease with a better outcome is identified in the users.877,879,895 In addition, a prospective cohort study found little impact of hormone use on mammography specificity.901

Differing with many reports in the literature, the WHI concluded that their results suggested that invasive breast cancers diagnosed in women who use HT may have a worse prognosis, basing this conclusion on the differences observed in tumor size and spread of disease. As discussed previously, it is well recognized that the participants in the WHI represent an older postmenopausal population (average age 63 and an average of about 12 years since menopause in the estrogen-progestin arm). This older population is more likely to have preexisting occult tumors that would become detectable quickly after hormonal stimulation. In addition, breast tissue in older postmenopausal women may respond differently to hormone stimulation than breast tissue in women close to their menopause. It is possible that the WHI results reflect this older population who might have occult tumors that are in fact larger and more prone to respond to hormonal stimulation than tumors in younger women.

There is another problem with the WHI data on tumor size and stage of disease. The WHI reported that estrogen-progestin users had slightly larger

tumors (an average of 2 mm) and less localized disease. However, there are reasons both obvious and not apparent, why the WHI data disagree with the great bulk of the literature. First, no nodes were examined in nearly 10% of the subjects who developed breast cancer; information was missing on node involvement in 4.0% of the treated group and 4.7% of the placebo group and on tumor size in 6.5% of the treated group and 6.0% of the placebo group. Because case numbers were not large, a change in a few cases could change the conclusions. Next, the WHI investigators assumed that tumors less than 1 cm in size with no node information should be classified as localized disease, and those greater than 1 cm in size were not staged. According to the U.S. Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) data, breast tumors 1 cm in diameter have a 20% incidence of positive nodes.902 Finally, there is a major problem that is hard to explain. The WHI conclusion of less localized disease in hormone users is based on, once again, a difference in the placebo group, a surprisingly low incidence of positive nodes. There is a linear relationship between tumor diameter and the percent of cases with positive nodes.902 The average tumor size in the placebo group was 1.5 cm, and according to US data, this should give about a 25% incidence of positive nodes, not the 15.8% that was reported.902-905 Why is the placebo group different? Whatever the reason, it influences the conclusion.

In 2008, the WHI investigators had reported health outcomes at 3 years after the estrogen-progestin arm of the clinical trial was terminated.906 This follow-up report had included 15,730 participants who were followed from July 2002 to April 2005 (95% of randomized women). No increase in cardiovascular events, including venous thrombosis, in the women treated with estrogen-progestin was observed in the follow-up period. There were 79 cases of invasive breast cancer in the treated group in the follow-up period compared with 60 in the placebo group, a difference that gave an HR of 1.27, but it was not statistically significant. There was no difference in cases of colorectal cancer or fractures and a nonsignificant decrease in endometrial cancer in the treated group. There was a greater rate of mortality in the treatment group in the follow-up period, but this difference was small and not statistically significant. This WHI follow-up report concluded that the trend of increasing breast cancer during the trial period did not extend into the follow-up period. However, in 2020, the WHI

investigators reported on 20 years of follow-up of participants of both estrogen plus progestin and estrogen-alone hormone trials.868 Unlike findings at 3-year follow-up, the difference in breast cancer incidence between the estrogen plus progestin versus placebo groups differed significantly at 20 years median follow-up (annualized rate was 0.45% in the E+P arm vs 0.36% in the placebo arm; HR \= 1.28; 95% CI \= 1.13-1.45; *P* \< 0.001). Reassuringly, despite the incidence of breast cancer being higher in estrogen plus progestin group, there was no significant difference in breast cancer mortality between E+P and placebo groups (annualized mortality rate was 0.045% in the E+P vs 0.035% in the placebo arm; HR \=

1.35; 95% CI \= 0.94-1.95; *P* \= 0.11). Unlike findings of the WHI E+P hormone trial, the previously observed reduction in breast cancer incidence in the estrogen-alone hormone trial was noted to persist at a median of 20 years of follow-up (annualized rate was 0.30% in participants in the E-alone arm vs 0.37% in the placebo group; HR \= 0.78; 95% CI \= 0.65-0.93; *P* \= 0.005). Furthermore, breast cancer-related mortality was also significantly lesser in postmenopausal participants of the estrogen-alone arm of WHI compared to placebo (annualized mortality rate in the E-exposed group was 0.031% vs 0.046% in the placebo group; HR \= 0.60; 95% CI \= 0.37-0.97; *P* \= 0.04). In reporting this extended follow-up on WHI hormone trial participants, the WHI investigators rightly conclude that “the influence of menopausal hormone therapy on breast cancer remains unsettled with discordant findings from observational studies and randomized clinical trials.”868

**The Impact of Hormone Therapy on Breast Density and on Mastalgia**

An increase in mammographic breast density occurs at a greater rate in postmenopausal hormone users who develop mastalgia.907 According to the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) and WHI clinical trials, about 25% to 30% of women receiving combinations of estrogen and progestin develop breast tenderness.907,908

The subject of greatest clinical relevance, in our view, is the connection between breast tenderness and breast density and ultimately an impact, if any, on the risk of breast cancer. Although the increase in new-onset breast tenderness is associated with a greater increase in mammographic breast density compared with women who do not develop mastalgia, it is worth noting that one study asking whether hormone-induced changes in breast density increase the risk of breast cancer could find no evidence that this was so.909

A report from the WHI concluded that new-onset breast tenderness in the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI was associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (HR \= 1.48; CI \= 1.08-2.03) when compared to women who did not develop mastalgia.908 The WHI report gave the impression that this linkage was of sufficient magnitude that it should be a major clinical concern, but there are reasons to place it in a different perspective.

The WHI compared the numbers for sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value with the Gail model, implying clinical worthiness by their similarity. However, the positive predictive value of new-onset mastalgia in the WHI was only 2.7%, meaning that 97.3% of the women would be expected not to develop breast cancer\! Furthermore, in the references cited by the WHI to support their use of the Gail model, one actually concluded that the Gail model is not particularly sensitive in identifying individuals at risk, and the other was a study of false-positive mammogram screening.910,911 A positive predictive value of 2.7% is not clinically strong.

The WHI report appropriately acknowledges the increase in breast tenderness noted in some postmenopausal women treated with HT and the link between mastalgia and an increase in mammographic density; however, the WHI report discusses these subjects as if it has accepted that the

hormone-induced increase in density is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Let us consider these issues.

Increased density impairs the detection of breast masses.912 A failure to detect masses because of high tissue density causes an increase in interval cancers (cancers that present between mammographic screenings; in other words, cancers diagnosed after a negative mammogram).913 Difficulties in reading high-density mammograms also produce false-positive recalls (patients who are recalled for assessment and found not to have cancer). Being recalled for reassessment after an initial mammogram is a cause of significant psychological stress.914 In addition, at least 25% of the overall cost of mammographic screening in one US program was attributed to investigations of false-positive readings.911

These two problems, an increase in interval cancers (a decrease in mammographic sensitivity) and an increase in false-positive recalls (a decrease in mammographic specificity), are consistent with a possible decrease in the detection of cancer. Thus, the concern with dense breasts in postmenopausal women is a reduced quality of mammograms that would decrease the ability to detect early breast cancers.

Factors that are associated with greater breast density are nulliparity, older age at first birth, and current use of postmenopausal HT.915 Mammographically, dense breasts reflect a high proportion of stromal, ductal, and glandular tissue, associated with epithelial and stromal cell proliferation.916 The likelihood of dense breasts in hormone nonusers decreases with advancing age and increasing body weight as glandular tissue is replaced by fat.915 The link with nulliparity supports the contention that a full-term pregnancy early in life produces a change in structure in the breast that persists throughout life and is associated with resistance to proliferation.

Assessing the impact of breast density on the risk of breast cancer is complicated by two factors that produce heterogeneous data: (1) results from programs with biennial screening are less favorable when compared with annual screening and the available data are derived from both, and (2) results from recent years are better, reflecting improvements in technology. Nevertheless, high breast density (75% dense) on mammography in *hormone nonusers* is reported to be associated with a 4- to 6-fold increased risk of breast cancer.917-920 **Although HT increases breast density in some**

**women, it is not certain that the short-term increase in density with HT changes an individual’s risk of breast cancer.**

More current users of HT have denser breasts than nonusers.915,921-924 In women younger than age 55, it is difficult to find any differences between hormone users and nonusers.185 The impact is essentially limited to women older than age 55\. The effect of HT on breast density occurs rapidly; thus, duration of use has no effect.185 In the PEPI 3-year randomized trial, almost all increases occurred within the first year, with an increase in breast density observed in 8% of estrogen users and 19% to 24% of estrogen-progestin users and only 2% in the placebo group.925 The users of estrogen-progestin combined regimens had a greater risk of developing denser breasts compared with estrogen-alone treatment (7- to 13-fold greater in the PEPI trial with no differences observed comparing MPA to micronized progesterone).925 In the WHI, estrogen-progestin use increased density in an average of 6.0% of users in the first year, with attenuation in the second year to 4.9%.926 In careful studies, the daily, continuous, combined estrogen-progestin regimens have been reported to have a greater effect than sequential regimens, with an increase in density occurring within the first months of treatment and then maintained with no change.335,336,927-929

**Therefore, HT increases breast density mainly in older postmenopausal women, more women respond to combined estrogen-progestin regimens** (**especially the daily, continuous programs**)**, and the effect occurs within the first months of use and remains stable with no changes or some attenuation with increasing duration of use. However, this effect is only seen in at most about 25% of estrogen-progestin users, but usually around 10% of hormone users; indeed, it should be emphasized that most women do not respond in this manner.**

Overall, studies have suggested that hormone users experience a decrease in mammographic sensitivity with a lesser impact on specificity (false-recall rates). However, the studies are based on small numbers of interval cancers, and it is uncertain how real or how large this effect is because of the difficulty in controlling for confounding factors (eg, age, age at menopause, and time since menopause). If the effectiveness of breast cancer screening is reduced by postmenopausal HT, one would expect an adverse impact on breast cancer mortality. Instead, a study that indicated a reduction  in  mammographic  sensitivity  also  reported  smaller,  more

differentiated (grade I) tumors among the users compared with the nonusers,336 and most of the studies that have examined breast cancer mortality rates of women who had used postmenopausal HT, as reviewed earlier, have documented improved survival rates.

If breast density and breast cancer were a reflection only of hormone exposure, a strong preponderance of ER-positive tumors would be expected in women with increased density. However, women with increased density demonstrated equal increases in risk for both ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers, and one study found a preponderance of ER-negative tumors in hormone users with dense breasts.930,931 This suggests that other factors besides hormone exposure are involved in the relationship between density and breast cancer. For example, there is an association between breast density and family history of breast cancer, indicating an underlying genetic basis for both density and breast cancer.932 In a case-control study that assessed the relationship between HT and breast density, leaner women were more likely to increase their breast densities with HT, but there was no association between the response to hormones and family history, late age at first birth, or history of benign breast disease; the study concluded that recognized risk factors influenced the response to HT only to a minor degree, suggesting again that unknown genetic factors are involved.933 In a study designed to correlate histologic findings in dense breast tissue, an increase in fibrous stroma and type 1 lobules was observed to be more prevalent in hormone users, but these changes were also present in nonhormone users, and overall, there was no statistically significant difference between histologic features and breast density in women undergoing mastectomy for breast cancer.934 If breast density in postmenopausal women were strictly related to the hormonal environment, a drastic reduction in the estrogen milieu of the breast should have a salutary impact on density. The MAP1 randomized trial evaluated the effect of letrozole treatment on breast density; no effect of AI administration on breast density was observed despite 1 year of treatment.935

A Swedish study looked at the type of progesterone and breast density, with estradiol and either NETA or DRSP. Because of its antiandrogenic and mineralocorticoid actions, DRSP was hypothesized to perform differently than NETA. One hundred and twenty healthy, naturally postmenopausal women were randomized to either 2 mg of DRSP or 0.5 mg of NETA;

either progestin was administered as a continuous regimen in combination with 1 mg of oral E2 for 6 months, and investigators chose to examine the impact of choice of hormone regimen on two recognized surrogates for breast cancer risk, mammography, and fine-needle aspiration biopsy; testing was performed at baseline and at 6 months following initiation of intervention. A statistically significant increase in breast density was noted in both groups, and the magnitude of this change from baseline was comparable in DRSP and NETA groups. Proliferation of breast epithelial cells also significantly increased in both groups but was slightly yet significantly more pronounced in the E2/DRSP compared to NETA group. The change in breast cell proliferation at 6 months compared to baseline for E2/DRSP was 2.5% versus 0.7% for E2/NETA (*P* \< 0.01); while these differences were of statistical significance, clinical implications, if any, of this minimal differential in proliferative effects of two commonly utilized progestins are unclear.936

The combination of the LNG intrauterine contraceptive device and ET in postmenopausal women does not seem to increase breast density as assessed by mammography.937,938 However, recent data utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are suggestive of systemic effects of LNG-IUD as an increase in background parenchymal enhancement in breast MRI has been described in LNG-IUD users.939

The increase in breast density associated with HT appears in some studies to be a transient, reversible change, a change not consistent with a *persistent* effect on cellular proliferation. After discontinuing HT, it was reported that breast density rapidly decreases after HT is discontinued so that former users do not display an increase compared to never-users.915,924,940,941 In a retrospective analysis, regression of hormone-induced abnormalities was found to occur within 2 to 3 weeks of cessation of treatment.941,942 However, in a large randomized trial of 1,704 women aged 45 to 80 years, although suspension of HT for 1 or 2 months produced small but significant decreases in density, mammography recall rates of 10% to 12% were not affected.943 Furthermore, a nonrandomized before and after study (but of only 47 women) detected no significant changes in mammographic density after a 4-week cessation of HT.944 Besides discontinuing HT, another approach is to consider lower doses of hormones;

there is some evidence that low-dose treatment has little effect on breast density.945

**The Effect of Hormone Therapy on Mammographic Screening**

The impact of screening mammography has been established by multiple randomized trials: about a 28% reduction in breast cancer mortality in women aged 50 years and above.946 At the same time, it is recognized that it is difficult for mammography to detect noncalcified masses, especially in dense breasts. This sensitivity problem has been improved by digital mammography, but not eliminated.

Does the hormonal effect on breast density impair mammographic screening? In other words, is there an increase in interval cancers and false-positive recalls in postmenopausal hormone users? In a review of seven studies, there were relatively few interval cancers in the user groups;

nevertheless, six of the seven studies reported decreased mammographic sensitivity in hormone users with a small increase in interval cancers in users compared with nonusers.947 Excluding women under age 50, the RR for an interval cancer was summarized as 1.7 (CI \= 1.2-2.4). American, Scottish, and Australian studies have indicated a 5% to 20% decrease in mammographic sensitivity in hormone users who have dense breasts.948-951 A Finnish study concluded that women with the densest breasts, and using hormones, had the highest RR of breast cancer, but this conclusion was based on only four cases of cancer in women with dense breasts.952

The risk of false-positive recall (mammographic specificity) was investigated in five studies.948,952-955 The rate of false-positive recall in nonusers ranged from 2.1% in the United Kingdom to as high as 14.7% in an American program; four of the five studies found a slight increase in the risk of false-positive recalls in hormone users. In a French study, mammographic sensitivity was reduced from 92% to 71% in users because of an incidence of interval cancers that was 3.5 times that of nonusers within the first year of the initial examination and 1.7 times greater during the following 2 years.953 Most of the hormone users were on combined estrogen-progestin regimens. The false-positive recall rate was only slightly higher, 3.3% in users and 2.8% in nonusers. A prospective study of screening mammograms from Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that recall rates were essentially the same comparing hormone users and nonusers and that HT rarely causes a diagnostic dilemma.954 However, in New Hampshire, increased breast density and use of HT independently increased the need for supplemental imaging.955

Treatment with either estrogen alone or estrogen-progestin in the WHI was associated with more abnormal mammograms compared with placebo.866,956 The difference was about 12% with estrogen-progestin and 8% with estrogen alone, but remember the characteristics of the participants differed in the two arms of the clinical trial. Nevertheless, the higher prevalence with estrogen-progestin is consistent with the other studies in the literature. Overall, the studies have suggested a decrease in mammographic sensitivity with a small impact on specificity (false-recall rates).

***Adding Ultrasound to Mammography***

The American College of Radiology conducted a prospective, multicenter, randomized trial in 21 centers in the United States, with 2,725 women, designed to validate the performance of screening ultrasound in conjunction with mammography in women with dense breasts and at high risk for breast cancer.957 Each patient underwent mammography and ultrasound in a randomized sequence. Forty cases of cancer were diagnosed, 12 on ultrasound alone, 12 on mammography alone, 8 suspicious with both techniques, and 8 with negative examinations. Adding ultrasound yielded an additional 4.2 cancers per 1,000 high-risk women. The false-positive rate for mammography alone was 4.4%, for ultrasound alone 8.1%, and for combined mammography plus ultrasound 10.4%. **Thus, adding ultrasound to mammography screening in high-risk women with dense breasts improved the sensitivity of screening but increased the rate of false-positive examinations. Breast cancer mortality was not an end point in this trial, but the fact that the cancers detected by ultrasound are usually asymptomatic, node negative, and not detected by mammography should yield a reduction in mortality.**

Ultrasound screening can detect cancers not seen on mammography, and its performance is not affected by dense breast tissue. Adding ultrasound to a screening program seems straightforward, but its impact on mortality reduction has not been measured in a large trial. In the single-center studies of screening ultrasound that have been published, cancers have been found only by ultrasound, and most are small, early-stage tumors. An Italian multicenter study reported that 29 cancers were found by ultrasound in 6,449 women with dense breasts and negative mammograms.958

The problem with all screening methods is a substantial rate of false positives. In the American study, 91.4% of suspicious ultrasound findings were benign.957 The positive predictive value for ultrasound was only 8.6%, but the value for mammography was 14.7%. The crucial question is how many false positives are worth the gain in additional cancer diagnoses. In the American study, the gain was an additional 29% (the number of cancers detected only by ultrasound). In women with elevated risks, this seems worthwhile.

**Combining MRI with mammography yields a very high sensitivity, and this is now recommended for women at very high risk for breast cancer.** Breast MRI is the most sensitive technique, but it is very expensive,

requires the intravenous injection of contrast, and is not always tolerated by patients. Ultrasound has the advantage of being less expensive, easily tolerated, and widely available. Thus, the combination of ultrasound and mammography seems best for women of intermediate risk. Ultrasound has a disadvantage of not detecting ductal carcinoma in situ, which is detected by mammography and MRI.

In general, supplemental screening for dense breasts (either ultrasound or MRI) will identify more breast cancers (invasive cancers), but it may come at the cost of increased false-positive rates and biopsies.959 What is not known, however, is if cancers identified from ultrasound and MRI have improved outcomes and reduced mortality.959 **Further research studies are clearly needed.**

## Key Points: Mammography Screening

**There is sufficient evidence to support utilizing more than one screening technique** (**mammography, ultrasound, and MRI**) **for high-risk patients defined as a combination of factors that produces a 3-fold increase in risk, especially in women with radiographically dense breast tissue. Thus far, over 90% of cancers detected only on ultrasound have been in women with dense breasts. Therefore, it seems advisable to add ultrasonography to mammography for hormone users who develop dense breasts, and the density persists despite a short period without HT. In addition, digital screening mammography is superior to conventional film screening for women with dense breasts.**960

**Hormone users who develop an increase in breast density have a small decrease in mammography sensitivity and an increase in false recalls. An adverse impact of this increase in breast density is not apparent in breast cancer mortality statistics in hormone users. Digital mammography is preferred for women with dense breasts.**  
**Ultrasonography should be added to mammography screening in hormone users who develop dense breasts with no regression after a short period without hormone treatment.**

**The Effect of Progestins in Combined Regimens**

Overall, studies support the conclusion that the RR of breast cancer is higher in users of combinations of estrogen and progestin. The effect is confined to ER-positive, PR-positive (ER+/PR+) tumors, mainly lobular cancers. **What if this conclusion reflects early detection of better-differentiated tumors, a consequence of a favorable response of preexisting tumors to estrogen-progestin exposure?**

Almost every study that has reported an increase in breast cancer risk with postmenopausal HT has found the increase within a few years. Remember that although the doubling time of breast cancer is variable, in general, a tumor doubles in size every 100 days. Thus, it takes a single malignant cell approximately 7 years to become detectable by mammography and 10 years to grow to a clinically detectable 1-cm mass.961 The rapid finding of an increased risk within a few years of exposure to HT suggests that the epidemiologic studies are detecting preexisting tumors.

Older studies on the hormone receptor content in breast cancers diagnosed in hormone users were limited by small numbers. Furthermore, recent studies examining receptor status are likely to be more accurate in that receptor status assays have improved. In the Nurses’ Health Study, the use of postmenopausal HT has been associated with a significant increase in ER+/PR+ breast cancer, but not in receptor-negative disease.962 This relationship, greatest in lean women, was stronger and observed sooner with the use of estrogen-progestin, a significant increase with 5 or fewer years of combined use and no increase with 5 or fewer years of the use of estrogen alone. In a cohort of women from the area of Lund, Sweden, an increased risk of breast cancer was reported only in users of continuous combined estrogen-progestin, and this increase was observed within 2 years of use.963 Other epidemiologic studies have reported a similar greater risk in current users of continuous, combined estrogen-progestin, concentrated in ER-positive disease.847,850,853,964,965 Indeed, the use of HT is the greatest predictor of ER-positive disease.966 In a retrospective study in the Northern California Kaiser program, only the current use of combined estrogen and progestin increased the odds of ER-positive tumors.967

E3N is a French prospective cohort study initiated in 1990, which concluded that it would be preferable to use progesterone or dydrogesterone because estrogen use with these two progestins was not associated with an increase in the RR of invasive breast cancer.968,969 For any given progestin,

the route of administration of estrogen (oral or transdermal) had no effect on RR. A statistically significant increase in RR was associated with estrogen alone (RR \= 1.29; CI \= 1.02-1.65) and with progestins other than progesterone or dydrogesterone (RR \= 1.69; CI \= 1.50-1.91). The increased RRs seemed to rapidly dissipate after discontinuation of treatment; although this analysis was initially limited by small numbers, it was confirmed in a later follow-up.970

The French study argued that their results indicate that the “natural” progestins are safer than “synthetic” progestins. However, to accurately differentiate among various agents, one would have to be certain that the doses administered represented bioequivalent doses in terms of target tissue impact, something that would be difficult to do. Let us focus on the rapidity at which cases of breast cancer were identified. The use of estrogen combined with “other progestins” had an increased RR even with less than 2 years of exposure (RR \= 1.37; CI \= 1.07-1.72). In their earlier report, an increased RR was even apparent with less than 1 year of exposure of estrogen combined with synthetic progestins.968 **The results in the French study could be due to earlier detection of preexisting tumors, an effect accelerated by specific progestins with greater potency.**

A follow-up report from the French study indicated that the increased risk of breast cancer was evident only in women with recent use of HT and not in past users.970 Furthermore, the risk with short-term use was confined to hormone use with synthetic progestins for 2 years or fewer in the 3-year period immediately following menopause. With longer duration of hormone use, the risk was apparent even in those who initiated treatment years after the menopause. The logical conclusion is that this striking finding with short-term use early in the postmenopausal years reflects an impact of HT on preexisting tumors.

More recently, a study from England analyzed real-world data on nearly 100,000 women with a primary diagnosis of breast cancer between 1998 and 2018, and 457,498 female controls matched by age, general practice, and index date; relationships of HT use, duration of exposure, and type of HT with breast cancer were examined.971 An increased rate of breast cancer was noted for current users of HT with less than 5 or greater than 5 years of hormone use (either estrogen alone or combination of estrogen and progestin) as well as for previous users of combination HT for more than 5

years. The authors have carefully placed their findings into practical counseling terms for patients and providers in indicating that there were approximately 3 to 8 extra cases per 10,000 women years for current estrogen-only users, 9 to 36 per 10,000 in current combination therapy users, and 2 to 8 per 10,000 for previous greater than 5-year combination HT users. This study also broke down the higher risk types of progestogens and can serve as a meaningful guide toward counseling patients on HT-related risks.

Molecular biology studies have attempted to gain clarity on the effects of estrogens and various progestins in HT formulations on breast cancer risk. In vitro studies using microarray analysis have profiled the gene network both up- and downregulated by estrogen.972 Genes that are upregulated by estrogen are downregulated by estrogen-progestin treatment.973 Comparing hormone users and nonusers, 276 genes were activated by hormone exposure (11 of the 13 women used estrogen-progestin and 2 used estrogen alone). All patients in this cluster were free of recurrence 5 years after diagnosis. In a cohort of 131 women, those patients exhibiting the gene profile associated with estrogen-progestin exposure preferentially benefited from tamoxifen treatment.973 This Swedish study found that estrogen-progestin use altered the gene expression profile only in ER-positive cancers. Among the genes regulated, many were involved in either DNA repair or cell cycle regulation. For example, the p63 gene, involved in tumor differentiation, was overexpressed in estrogen-progestin users. Previous reports have found this gene to be expressed in normal tissue, partially expressed in ductal hyperplasia and not invasive cancers.974

It is well recognized that early pregnancy produces a mammary gland that is resistant to carcinogenesis. In rodents, this is accomplished by treatment with estrogen plus a progestin. The refractory phenotype that is produced is associated with progestin-induced changes in gene expression involved in cell proliferation.975

The PR is induced by estrogens at the transcriptional level and decreased by progestins at both the transcriptional and translational levels (probably through receptor phosphorylation).976 The PR has two major isoforms, designated the A and B receptors.977 The two forms are expressed by a single gene, a consequence of transcription from distinctly different promoters, in a complex system of transcription regulation.978 Progestational

agents can elicit a variety of responses determined by target tissue production and activity of the two receptor forms with dimerization as AA and BB (homodimers) or AB (heterodimer).

PR-A and PR-B are expressed in various amounts in breast cancer and endometrial cancer cell lines. Studies indicate that the two receptors can be regulated independently; for example, the relative levels differ in the endometrium during the menstrual cycle.979 Tissue specificity with the PR is influenced by which receptor and which dimer is active, and in addition, the transcriptional activities of PR-A and PR-B depend on target cell differences, especially in promoter context. In most cells, PR-B is the positive regulator of progesterone-responsive genes, and PR-A inhibits PR-B activity. Thus, repression of human ER transcriptional activity (as well as glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid, and androgen transcription) is dependent on the expression of PR-A.980,981 The PR-A and PR-B have different molecular functions, affecting different genes, and, therefore, target tissue response to progesterone will be influenced by the differential expression of each receptor and the ratio of their concentrations, as well as the target tissue context of adaptor proteins.982,983
