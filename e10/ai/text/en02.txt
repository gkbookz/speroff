A TVUS study can also help in identifying intracavitary lesions, particularly with intracavitary instillation of saline.189 Saline infusion sonohysterogram (SHG) can identify intracavitary lesions (ie, polyps and submucosal fibroids) that can be missed on routine 2D TVUS.189 The sensitivity and specificity of TVUS for identifying intrauterine pathology are 56% to 73%,190 whereas SHG has a sensitivity of 96% to 100% and a negative predictive value of 94% to 100% in evaluating for uterine pathology.189 Hysteroscopy has an accuracy of 96% for intracavitary

pathology, with abnormalities seen in about 47% of premenopausal and postmenopausal women with AUB.157

If the endometrial assessment is unremarkable but abnormal bleeding persists, then for reasons of both accuracy and cost-effectiveness, the next step should be of endometrial biopsy; when no focal pathology is evident on screening, then it is appropriate for the method of endometrial biopsy to be an office-based procedure. We recommend the use of a plastic endometrial suction device (such as a pipelle) as the procedure is easy to perform, requires no cervical dilation, and is frequently well tolerated and equipment is routinely available even in low-resource settings. An office-based endometrial biopsy has been shown to offer tissue yield that is closely comparable to D\&C and has an 83% sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer. Insertion should first be attempted without the use of a tenaculum. In many patients, this is feasible and avoids the sensation of the tenaculum grasping the cervix. Once the suction is applied, the endometrial cavity should be thoroughly curetted in all directions, just as it would with a sharp curette during a D\&C. Although most patients report no problems with cramps or pain, the application of suction in some patients stimulates cramping that usually passes within 5 to 10 minutes. Because cramping can occur, an inhibitor of prostaglandin synthesis given at least 20 minutes before the procedure has been shown to minimize procedure-related discomfort. Less than 10% of postmenopausal women cannot be adequately evaluated by office biopsy. Most commonly, the reason is the inability to negotiate the cervical canal and gain entry into the uterine cavity. In such instances, it is very reasonable to proceed with procedure under anesthesia when a D\&C can be performed in the operating room; however, pretreatment with misoprostol or cervical laminaria may allow completion of office endometrial biopsy and thus avoid the need for anesthesia and D\&C. We recommend consideration for office hysteroscopy or an SHG prior to proceeding with office endometrial biopsy and undertaking concomitant hysteroscopy at the time of D\&C being undertaken for evaluation of AUB,157 provided access to the equipment is available and the surgeon has the requisite expertise. Following a negative hysteroscopy result, the chance of endometrial cancer diagnosis is 0.4% to 0.5%.157 If the vulva, vagina, and cervix appear normal on inspection, menopausal bleeding can be assumed to be intrauterine in origin. Confirmation requires

the absence of abnormal cytology on the Pap smear. The principal symptom of endometrial cancer is abnormal vaginal bleeding, but carcinoma will be encountered in patients with bleeding in less than 3% of postmenopausal endometrial biopsies.191-193 Normal endometrium is found over half the time, polyps in approximately 3%, endometrial hyperplasia about 15% of the time, and atrophic endometrium in the rest of patients with postmenopausal bleeding. Postmenopausal bleeding should always be taken seriously. Approximately 10% of patients who have benign findings at the initial evaluation subsequently develop significant pathology within 2 years.192 **The persistence of abnormal bleeding demands repeated evaluation.**

Additional procedures to consider include the following:

* **Colposcopy and cervical biopsy** for abnormal cytology or obvious lesions

* **Endocervical assessment** by curettage for abnormal cytology (the endocervix must always be kept in mind as a source for abnormal cytology)

Keep in mind that the pathologic reading, “tissue insufficient for diagnosis,” when a patient is on estrogen-progestin treatment, often represents atrophic, decidualized endometrium that yields little to the exploring curette. If the clinician is confident in his or her technique, knowing that a full investigation of the intrauterine cavity has been accomplished, then *as long as the patient’s bleeding does not persist*, this reading can be interpreted as comforting and benign, the absence of pathology. Specifically, as long as the clinician is certain that the true uterine cavity was sampled (ie, no false passage or stenotic os encountered), no further testing is indicated unless abnormal bleeding persists and risk factors for neoplasia are present. In the event of continued bleeding or concerning risk factors (ie, long-standing history of unopposed estrogen, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and nulliparity), consideration for referral to a gynecologic oncologist would be a prudent approach.

In the absence of organic disease, appropriate management of uterine bleeding is dependent on the age of the woman and endometrial tissue findings. In the menopausal woman with AUB associated with evidence of

simple endometrial hyperplasia (uncomplicated by atypia or dysplastic constituents), periodic oral progestin therapy is mandatory (such as 10-mg medroxyprogesterone acetate or 5- to 10-mg norethindrone acetate for 14 days each month). Intrauterine placement of a levonorgestrel intrauterine device (LNG-IUD) is increasingly being utilized as an effective management approach with high regression rates. Higher-dose oral progestins (such as 10- to 20-mg medroxyprogesterone acetate or 10- to 15-mg norethindrone acetate) are always an option and should be considered in the setting of obesity.194,195 Repeat endometrial sampling should be performed at 3 and 6 months of therapy. Most cases of simple hyperplasia will regress at 6 months; however, if there is no regression at 3 to 6 months, then increasing progestin dose or switching regimen (such as to megestrol acetate in daily doses of 40-80 mg or LNG-IUD) should be considered. Persistence or progression of abnormal endometrium was observed in 28.4% of women with complex hyperplasia and in 26.9% of women with atypical hyperplasia despite treatment with a progestational agent.196 At least two consecutive repeat negative biopsies should be conducted prior to stopping surveillance.194 In the absence of any regression after 1 year of progestin therapy, or if there is evidence of progression from simple or complex without atypia to atypical hyperplasia despite progestin therapy, then hysterectomy is indicated and referral to a gynecologic oncologist is strongly advised.194 Because hyperplasia *with atypia* carries with it a risk of concomitant cancer (even invasive), hysterectomy is the treatment of choice. However, progestational response was better with higher-dosage and longer-duration treatment. If histologic regression is not observed on office biopsy, a D\&C should be considered before proceeding with hysterectomy.

**Contraception in Perimenopause**

Clinicians have often utilized a traditional postmenopausal hormone regimen to treat a woman with the kind of irregular cycles usually experienced in the perimenopausal years. This addition of exogenous estrogen without a contraceptive dose of progestin when a woman is not amenorrheic or experiencing menopausal symptoms is inappropriate and even  risky  (exposing  the  endometrium  to  excessively  high  levels  of

estrogen). **In addition, most importantly, a postmenopausal hormonal regimen does not inhibit ovulation and provide contraception.**197 The appropriate response is to regulate anovulatory cycles with monthly progestational treatment along with an appropriate contraceptive method or to utilize low-dose estrogen-progestin contraception. An oral contraceptive that contains 20-μg estrogen provides effective contraception, improves menstrual cycle regularity, diminishes bleeding, and relieves menopausal symptoms.198 Treatment with the transdermal or vaginal method of estrogen-progestin contraception would also be appropriate.

A common clinical dilemma is when to change from estrogen—progestin contraception to postmenopausal hormone therapy. It is important to change because even with the lowest estrogen dose contraceptive available, the estrogen dose is at least 4-fold greater than the standard postmenopausal dose, and with increasing age, the dose-related risks with estrogen become significant. One approach is to start measuring the FSH level annually at 50 years on day six or seven of the placebo week in a standard 3-week regimen (when steroid levels have declined sufficiently to allow FSH to rise). When FSH is greater than 20 IU/L, it is time to change to a postmenopausal hormone program; however, FSH variability indicates this is not always an accurate method, and some women will not have an FSH rise until 2 weeks after the last active pill.199,200 Women who are dependent on contraceptives to prevent pregnancy can be allowed to enter their mid-50s on low-dose estrogen-progestin contraception and then empirically switched to a postmenopausal hormone regimen. **The empirical approach is necessary with patients using the newer extended-day or continuous dosing regimens of estrogen-progestin contraception.**

Because of the favorable impact of locally released progestin on the endometrium, the LNG-IUD is very effective for the treatment of menorrhagia, as effective as the administration of oral progestins (with less side effects), and compares favorably with endometrial resection or ablation.201-205 In addition, levonorgestrel IUD is more effective in treating endometrial hyperplasia than oral progesterone.206-214 The levonorgestrel IUD may be associated with a slight increase in the formation of ovarian cysts, but they are asymptomatic and resolve spontaneously.215

**Vasomotor Symptoms**

The vasomotor flush is viewed as the hallmark of the female climacteric, experienced to some degree by most postmenopausal women. The term “hot flush” or “hot flash” is descriptive of a sudden onset of reddening of the skin over the head, neck, and chest, accompanied by an increase in heart rate and a feeling of intense body heat. The flush sometimes concludes with profuse perspiration. The duration varies from a few seconds to several minutes and, rarely, for an hour. The frequency may be rare to recurrent every few minutes. Flushes are more frequent and severe at night (when a woman is often awakened from sleep) or during times of stress. In a cool environment, hot flushes are fewer, less intense, and shorter in duration compared with a warm environment.216 Most importantly, hot flushing can affect a woman’s quality of life and interfere with work or recreational activities.

In the longitudinal follow-up of a large number of women, fully 10% of the women experienced hot flushes before menopause, while in other studies as many as 15% to 25% of premenopausal women reported hot flushes.8,96,217,218 The frequency has been reported to be even higher in premenopausal women diagnosed with PMS.219 In the Massachusetts Women’s Health Study, the incidence of hot flushes increased from 10% during the premenopausal period to about 50% just after cessation of menses.96 By approximately 4 years after menopause, the rate of hot flushes declined to 20%. In a community-based Australian survey, 6% of premenopausal women, 26% of perimenopausal women, and 59% of postmenopausal women complained of hot flushing.220 A large American cross-sectional survey reported that 57% of perimenopausal women and 49% of early postmenopausal women experienced significant hot flushing.180 Another national survey in the United States reported hot flushing in 79% of perimenopausal women and 65% of postmenopausal women.221

In cross-sectional surveys, up to 40% of premenopausal women and 85% of menopausal women report some vasomotor complaints.218 A longitudinal study in Gothenburg, Sweden, recorded a maximal prevalence of 60% at ages 52 to 54, with a decline to 30% at age 60 and 9% at age

72\.222 In the SWAN study, 57% of perimenopausal women experienced hot

flushing and about 50% after menopause up to age 55\.223 There is no difference in the prevalence of vasomotor complaints in US surveys of Black and White women.224,225 Overweight women report more hot flushing, perhaps reflecting the effect of body fat causing a higher core body temperature.180,182,226 Exact estimates on prevalence are hampered by inconsistencies and differences in methodologies, cultures, and definitions.227 The prevalence in different societies is influenced by personal and social attitudes, individual psychological and physical health, familiarity with the portrayal of menopausal issues in the literature and media, ethnic variation, different diets, and dissimilar living conditions; however, accounting for cultural differences, the overall prevalence and experience are similar throughout the world.228,229

**Although the flush can occur in the premenopause, it is a major feature of the menopause transition and postmenopause, peaking in the first year after the last menses, lasting in 50% of women for 4 to 5 years, but in some (as many as 25%) for longer than 5 years, and even up to 15 years in 10% (Table 21.5)**.230 **In an excellent Australian longitudinal cohort study, the average duration of VMS was 5.2 years (with a range of 2-10 years) in nonusers of hormone therapy and slightly longer, 5.5 years, in hormone users.**231 **In the SWAN cohort, the median total duration of VMS was 7.4 years. Women who were premenopausal or early perimenopausal at first reporting of frequent symptoms experienced the longest duration (median,** \>**11.8 years) and post-FMP persistence (median, 9.4 years), whereas women who first experienced VMS after onset of menopause had the shortest total duration of symptoms (median, 3.4 years).**232

The physiology of the hot flush is not entirely understood. In recent years, a pivotal role of the hypothalamic KNDy (Kisspeptin Neurokinin B, Dynorphin) neurons has been identified in driving the thermoregulatory response to estrogen deprivation.233,234 Studies suggest that women with hot flushes have a more narrow zone of temperature regulation and that, therefore, smaller changes in core body temperature produce compensatory responses, such as shivering or flushing.235 MRI scanning of the brain during hot flushing indicates widely distributed cortical activation rather than a precise location.236

Hot flushes are definitely brought about by a decline in estrogen; however, not all hot flushes are due to estrogen deficiency. Flushes and sweating can be secondary to diseases, including pheochromocytoma, carcinoid, leukemias, pancreatic tumors, and thyroid abnormalities.237 **When the clinical situation is not clear and obvious, estrogen deficiency as the cause of hot flushes should be documented by elevated levels of FSH.**

The correlation between the onset of flushes and estrogen reduction is clinically supported by the effectiveness of estrogen therapy and the absence of flushes in hypoestrogenic states, such as gonadal dysgenesis. Only after estrogen is administered and withdrawn do hypogonadal women experience the hot flush. Although the clinical impression that premenopausal surgical castrates suffer more severe vasomotor reactions is

widely held, this was not borne out in the only objective study ever performed.238

The hot flush is the most common problem of the peri and early postmenopausal period. The flush is accompanied by a discrete and reliable pattern of physiologic changes.235,239 The flush coincides with a surge of LH (not FSH) and is preceded by a subjective prodromal awareness that a flush is beginning. This aura is followed by measurable increased heat over the entire body surface. A flush is triggered by a small elevation in core body temperature. The body surface experiences an increase in temperature, accompanied by changes in skin conductance, and then the flush is followed by a fall in core temperature—all of which can be objectively measured. In short, the flush is not a release of accumulated body heat but a sudden inappropriate excitation of heat release mechanisms. Its relationship to the LH surge and temperature change within the brain is not understood. The observation that flushes occur after hypophysectomy indicates that the mechanism is not dependent on or due directly to LH release. In other words, the same brain event that causes flushes also stimulates GnRH secretion and elevates LH. It is now understood that estrogen exerts suppressive effects on the hypothalamic KNDy neurons, which in turn directly modulate the thermoregulatory center. The loss of estrogen results in activation of the KNDy neurons and consequent release of neurotransmitters that increase neuronal and autonomic activity with resetting of the thermoregulatory center and episodic activation of heat dissipation cascade, resulting in the vasomotor episode of the flash **(Figure 21.10)**.233,234,240

Premenopausal women experiencing hot flushes should be screened for thyroid disease and other illnesses. A comprehensive review of all possible causes is available.241 Clinicians should be sensitive to the possibility of an underlying emotional problem. Looking beyond the presenting symptoms into the patient’s life is an important service to the patient and her family that will eventually be appreciated. This is far more difficult than simply prescribing estrogen, but confronting problems is the only way of reaching some resolution.

A striking and consistent finding in most studies dealing with menopause and hormonal therapy is a marked placebo response (at least 51% in the first weeks of treatment)242 in a variety of symptoms, including

flushing. In a randomized, placebo-controlled English study of women being treated with estrogen implants and requesting repeat implants, there was no difference in outcome in terms of psychological and physical symptoms on comparing the women who received an active implant to those receiving a placebo.243

A significant clinical problem encountered in our referral practice is the following scenario: a woman will occasionally undergo an apparently beneficial response to estrogen, only to have the response wear off in several months despite ongoing use of prescribed hormonal regimen. Rather than continuously increasing the estrogen dose, it is important to consider altering the mode of delivery (ie, switching from oral to transdermal) or timing of medication (ie, if administering orally, consider twice-daily dosing if giving estradiol as opposed to CEE). Importantly, uncommon differential diagnoses, such as pheochromocytoma or carcinoid, must be entertained when encountering recalcitrant VMS that remain unresponsive to increasing doses of estrogen therapy. Additionally, a careful inquiry must be undertaken to search for underlying psychosocial problems. To help persuade a patient that her symptoms are not due to low levels of estrogen, we find it very helpful and convincing to measure the patient’s blood level of estradiol and share the result with her.

**The Genitourinary Syndrome of Menopause**

Although vaginal dryness may be experienced during the perimenopause, symptoms such as those of vaginitis, pruritus, dyspareunia, and frequent urinary tract infections, which are attributable to atrophy of vaginal mucosal surfaces, worsen as women advance into postmenopausal years and can contribute to worsening quality of life.244

Urethritis with dysuria, urgency incontinence, and urinary frequency are results of mucosal thinning of the urethra and bladder.245 Recurrent urinary tract infections are effectively prevented by postmenopausal intravaginal estrogen treatment.245 However, certain anatomic conditions, such as vaginal tissue relaxation with cystocele, rectocele, uterine prolapse, and vulvar dystrophies, that are common accompaniments to aging are not a consequence of estrogen deprivation.

Deprived of estrogen, the vagina loses collagen, adipose tissue, and the ability to retain water. As the vaginal walls shrink, the rugae flatten and disappear. The surface epithelium loses its outer fibrous layer and thins to a few layers of cells, markedly reducing the ratio of superficial to basal cells. As a result, the vaginal surface is left friable, prone to bleeding with minimal trauma. While these changes are occurring, the blood vessels in the vaginal walls narrow, and secretions from sebaceous glands diminish. Over time, the vagina itself contracts and loses flexibility, while the labia minora become paler and smaller. In addition, pH becomes more alkaline, making the vaginal environment less hospitable to lactobacilli and more susceptible to infection by urogenital and fecal pathogens. **Measuring pH is a simple way to determine estrogen’s influence or absence. A pH greater than**

**4.5 is almost always observed with estrogen deficiency.**246,247 Infecting organisms can ascend into the urinary system to cause urethritis, urinary tract infections, and cystitis.

Dyspareunia, sometimes with postcoital bleeding, is the inevitable consequence of a severely atrophied vagina with scant lubrication. Even for women who are not sexually active, atrophic vaginitis can cause itching, irritation, and burning. These symptoms often go unmentioned, and it is important to inspect for signs of vaginal atrophy even in the absence of complaints. Dyspareunia or vaginal discomfort seldom brings older women to see their gynecologists. A basic reluctance to discuss sexual behavior still permeates society, and per the literature summary from the North American Menopause Society (NAMS), anywhere between one-third and three-fourths of women who experience symptoms of estrogen deprivation do not discuss this with providers, while another one-third desire the providers to start the discussion (NAMS).

Objective measurements have demonstrated that vaginal factors that influence the enjoyment of sexual intercourse can be maintained by appropriate targeted treatment; until recently, only estrogen-based therapy was available to effectively address symptoms of vaginal atrophy, but now a postmenopausal woman can choose from a finite variety of hormonal and nonhormonal treatment options, which are further discussed in Chapter

22\.248 Both patient and clinician should be aware that a significant response can be expected by 1 month but that it can take a longer time to fully restore wellness of the genitourinary tract (6-12 months), and clinicians and

patients should not be discouraged by an apparent lack of immediate response. Vaginal dryness is worse with use of aromatase inhibitors commonly utilized as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal breast cancer and as chemoprophylaxis. Sexual activity by itself supports the circulatory response of the vaginal tissues and can itself improve vaginal tissue elasticity, stretchability as well as mucosal integrity as well as enhances the therapeutic effects of estrogen. Therefore, sexually active older women have less atrophy of the vagina, even without estrogen.

Although it is argued that genuine stress incontinence is not affected by treatment with estrogen, others contend that estrogen treatment improves or cures stress incontinence in over 50% of patients due to a direct effect on the urethral mucosa.249-251 A metaanalysis concluded that improvement was reported only in nonrandomized studies.252 Two randomized trials dedicated to this clinical problem failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of estrogen treatment.253,254 Most cases of urinary leakage in older women are due to a mixed problem with a significant component of urge incontinence, which, unlike stress incontinence, may be improved by estrogen therapy. However, the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) randomized trial indicated a worsening of incontinence with hormone therapy for both urge and stress incontinence, and the Nurses’ Health Study reported a small increase in incontinence in hormone users.255,256 In the SWAN study, only 15% of incontinent women reported a worsening of urinary incontinence during the menopausal transition, largely because of weight gain.257 The majority of incontinent women experienced either no change or an improvement. The SWAN study results imply that urinary incontinence is not a major symptom of menopause and the perimenopausal transition.257,258 In contrast, a Cochrane review from 2012 found that compared to placebo, women who received vaginal estrogen-based therapy for incontinence noted an improvement in symptoms.259 Interestingly, in trials using oral estrogen, women reported worsening of urinary symptoms.260 **Overall, data suggest that new-onset urinary incontinence at midlife is not a consequence of hormonal changes and, therefore, is not likely to be impacted with the use of estrogen.**

A decline in skin collagen content, elasticity, and skin thickness that occurs with aging can be considerably avoided by postmenopausal estrogen therapy.261-265 The effect of estrogen on collagen is evident in both bone and

skin; bone mass and collagen decline in parallel after menopause, and estrogen treatment reduces collagen turnover and improves collagen quality.266,267 Several studies demonstrated not only an increase in facial skin thickness but also an improvement in wrinkles, dryness, elasticity, and thickness with hormone therapy.268-271 Smoking is a major risk factor for facial skin wrinkling, and hormone therapy cannot diminish its negative impact.272 In a 1-year clinical trial, hormone therapy did not improve skin wrinkling already present.271

One of the features of aging in men and women is a steady reduction in muscular strength. Many factors affect this decline, including height, weight, and level of physical activity. Women currently using estrogen have been reported to demonstrate a lesser decline in muscular strength, although at least one study could detect no impact of estrogen.273-278 This is an important issue because of the potential protective consequences against fractures, as well as a benefit due to the ability to maintain vigorous physical exercise.

**Sexuality, Aging, and Menopause**

Sexuality is behavior that evolves and chances across the lifespan. It begins with birth (maybe before) and ends with death. The notion that sexuality ends with aging is inherently illogical. The need for closeness, caring, and companionship is lifelong. Old people today live longer, are healthier, have more education and leisure time, and have had their consciousness raised in regard to sexuality.

Younger people, especially physicians, underrate the extent of sexual interest in older people. In a random sample of women aged 50 to 82 in Madison, Wisconsin, nearly one-half of the women reported an ongoing sexual relationship.138 In the Duke longitudinal study on aging, 70% of men in the 67 to 77 age group were sexually active, and 80% reported continuing sexual interest, while 50% of all older women were still interested in sex.139 In the PEPI trial, 60% of women 55 to 64 years old were sexually active.140 In a national sample of American men and women, the prevalence of sexual behavior declined with aging; however, 26% of individuals aged 75 to 85 years were still sexually active.141 The prevalence of self-reported sexual problems peaks in middle-aged women, sufficient to

cause distress in about 22% of US women and about 12% of women aged 45 to 64\.142 Up to 23% of menopausal women are negatively affected by decreased sexual desire.143

The decline in sexual activity with aging is influenced by culture and attitudes, as well as by nature and physiology (or hormones). As estradiol regulates serotonergic function, it can affect desire and sexual function.143 In addition, the discomfort resulting from vaginal dryness and tissue atrophy consequent to low estradiol levels can make coitus unwelcome, even to the point of avoidance. Thus, a significant component of decline in sexual activity in reproductively aging women can be attributed to menopausal symptoms associated with decreasing estrogen levels, a problem that is easily ameliorated by targeted treatment.

There are two main sexual changes in the aging woman. There is a reduction in the rate of production and volume of vaginal lubricating fluid, and there is some loss of vaginal elasticity and thickness of the epithelium. Less vaginal atrophy is noted in sexually active women than in inactive women; presumably, the activity maintains vaginal vasculature and circulation. The spectrum of uncomfortable symptoms that are often described by transitioning and menopausal women with evidence of genital atrophy include a feeling of dryness and tightness, vaginal irritation and burning with penetration, and postcoital spotting and soreness. Given that these symptoms are the direct result of tissue estrogen deprivation, the underlying tissue changes can be effectively prevented by focal estrogen treatment. Systemic estrogen therapy may even have a positive impact on sexuality beyond effects on vaginal tissue.140 In an ancillary sexual study of the KEEPS—a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial—early menopausal women were randomized to receive either low-dose oral CEE or transdermal estradiol (transdermal E2), over the 4 years of intervention. While both routes of estrogen treatment resulted in an improvement in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia,143 improvements in libido and sexual satisfaction were observed only in transdermal E2 users.143 In an Australian study assessing changes in sexual functioning during the menopausal transition, a correlation with a decline in sexuality was demonstrated with estradiol levels but not with testosterone levels. There are likely many important factors other than hormone levels that are relevant in determining midlife sexual function.143,144

***Illness and Sex***

It is not uncommon to encounter medical or surgical underpinnings to disorders of sexuality. Surgical menopause (removal of both ovaries in premenopausal women) is probably one of the most commonly encountered iatrogenic contributors to altered sexual function. Remember that vaginal lubrication is an important physiologic sexual response, and therefore, vaginal dryness is a likely consequence following total hysterectomy even if the premenopausal ovaries are retained. Sexual problems are not limited, however, to surgical procedures and illnesses of the genitalia. Altered self-image such as following vulvectomy or mastectomy can also impact sexual function. However, studies have not found postmenopausal hysterectomy to have a detrimental impact on sexuality.140,145

Sexual counseling, to be effective, must be provided to couples both before and after surgery. It is not unexpected that the surgeon may not be fully capable of providing this counseling. A major contribution from an older woman’s primary clinician is to arrange for competent and experienced sexual counseling. Unfortunately, most physicians operate on the principle that if no questions are raised, there is no problem. The expert surgeon should be grateful for the help of experts in psychosexual therapy. Seek out the potential for posttreatment sexual morbidity before the surgery. Assess the patient’s abilities for coping and her sense of body image. Consider the quality of the patient’s relationship, and be sensitive to the absence of a relationship. This entire effort may take some time. The normal state of presurgical anxiety, fear, and denial hampers good communication.

Increasing use of SSRI antidepressants is another iatrogenic contributor to female sexual dysfunction that merits attention.146

Antihypertensive agents are frequently responsible for male sexual dysfunction, but little information is available regarding female sexual function. Adrenergic blocking agents are especially noted to affect libido and potency in men. Similarly, psychotropic drugs of all categories have been associated with inhibition of sexual function. Finally, one should always suspect alcoholism when patients complain of sexual dysfunction. Androgen treatment for decreased female sexuality is discussed later in this chapter.

The two most important influences on sexual satisfaction in aging couples are the strength of relationship and the physical condition of each partner.140,141,147 The single most significant determinant of sexual activity for older women is the lack of availability of partners due to divorce or demise as women are outliving men. Given availability of a partner, the same general high or low rate of sexual activity can be maintained throughout life.4,148 Longitudinal studies indicate that the level of sexual activity is more stable over time than previously suggested.149-151 Individuals who are sexually active earlier in life continue to be sexually active into old age. However, aging is associated with a decline in sexual function in many women, and this decline has been documented in the years well before the FMP.152,153

**Mental Health, Perimenopause, and Menopause**

The view that menopause has a deleterious effect on mental health or induces psychiatric disorders (involutional melancholia) is not supported in the psychiatric literature or in surveys of the general population, and this belief has been abandoned.217,218,279,280 Indeed, depression is less common among middle-aged women, and the menopause cannot be linked as causative to psychological distress.2-8,281,282 The longitudinal study of premenopausal women indicates that hysterectomy with or without oophorectomy is not associated with a negative psychological impact among middle-aged women.283,284 Longitudinal data from the Massachusetts Women’s Health Study document that menopause is not associated with an increased risk of depression.282 Although women are more likely to experience depression than men, this sex difference begins in early adolescence, not at menopause.285

The U.S. National Health Examination Follow-up Study includes both longitudinal and cross-sectional assessments of a nationally representative sample of women. This study has found no evidence linking either natural or surgical menopause to psychological distress.284 Indeed, the only longitudinal change was a slight decline in the prevalence of depression as women aged through the menopausal transition. Results in this study were the same in estrogen users and nonusers.
