**A negative view of mental health at the time of menopause is not justified; many of the problems reported at menopause are due to life events.**10,11,286,287 Thus, there are problems encountered in the perimenopausal transition and early postmenopause that are seen frequently, but their causal relation with estrogen is unlikely. These problems include fatigue, nervousness, headaches, insomnia, depression, irritability, and palpitations. Indeed, at this stage of life, both men and women express a multitude of complaints that do not reveal a gender difference that could be explained by a hormonal cause.288,289 Nevertheless, midlife women report complaints more often than men,289 perhaps reflecting the generally negative perceptions and connotations our cultures and societies have attributed to menopause.

Sleep disturbances are a common complaint during the menopausal transition and in early postmenopausal years.290 Difficulties with falling asleep and with staying asleep, sleep interruptions, and early awakenings are all more often encountered during menopausal transition and postmenopause than during the reproductive stage of aging. Disordered sleep itself can negatively affect health outcomes, including risk of depression.290 While hormonal changes can affect sleep, it has been difficult to establish the extent to which hormonal changes contribute to poor sleep. Several epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that men and women, on entering midlife, experience poor sleep quality.291 Increased nighttime awakening and an overall loss of total sleep time are common in women in the menopausal transition and postmenopause.291-294 Perhaps not surprisingly, nocturnal VMS (hot flushes and night sweats) likely contribute to sleep disturbances.291 The underlying body temperature dysregulation and stress activation during episodes of vasomotor phenomenon are detrimental to sleep.291 Studies assessing correlation between VMS and sleep patterns on polysomnography, however, are conflicting, suggesting the existence of unidentified confounders.291

The high prevalence of sleep issues during the menopausal transition and postmenopause has been suggested to contribute to depressive symptoms and to an overall decline in the quality of life.292-294 Two longitudinal cohort studies assessed the new onset of depressive symptoms and disorders during the menopausal transition. The Penn Ovarian Aging Study followed for over 8 years 436 women with no history of depression

and correlated hormonal changes with the onset of depressed mood.295 Fifty percent of the women developed an increase in measures of depression, and 26% met the criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depressive disorder. Using the women as their own controls, the depression group was 2.5 times more likely to develop clinical depression comparing status during the perimenopausal transition to the premenopausal state. These symptoms during the perimenopausal transition were associated with greater variability (but no average differences) in estradiol levels. These data suggest that fluctuations of estradiol can be an important destabilizing factor.

The Harvard Study of Moods and Cycles is a prospective cohort of women with and without histories of depression.296 In the women who entered the menopausal transition, the risk of new depression was almost doubled compared with premenopausal women, from 9.5% to 16.6%, and this risk was linked to the presence of VMS. Importantly, a statistically significant increase in risk of new depressive symptoms was present only in women with a history of adverse life events (the events are not defined or specified in the report). Also of note, 83% of the women experienced no mood changes.

The SWAN study reported similar results. A first episode of depression in perimenopausal women was linked to poor physical health, anxiety disorders, stressful life events, and hot flushing.297

Additional studies have shed further light on the role of VMS, sleep disturbances, and depressive symptoms. In a pooled analysis of eight studies from the InterLACE consortium, it was found that sleep difficulties related to VMS explained to a large extent the relationship between VMS and depressed mood.293 Interestingly, the OR of depressed mood associated with often/severe VMS was not significant when adjusted for baseline sleep disturbances at baseline.293 However, having an often/severe depressed mood remained associated with subsequent risk of VMS.293 Alternatively, using the SWAN cohort, a study by Kravitz et al noted that while sleep disturbances increased across the menopausal transition, they did not necessarily worsen over time.298 It is important to note, however, that VMS were significantly associated with the number of sleep disturbances experienced throughout the menopausal transition.298

This area of concern has been very difficult to study. Inconsistent results can reflect variations in study designs, selection of subjects, methods used to measure mood, and the definition of menopausal status. **However, the best reports provide reliable evidence that there may be a vulnerable population of women who do experience depression during menopause, and thus, the most important question is how to identify these women.**

Unfortunately, identifying this specific subset of women has been difficult. Depressive mood changes are influenced by numerous factors, including body weight, smoking, PMS (discussed in Chapter 14), employment, and marital status. **PMS during reproductive years is a strong predictor of depressive symptoms arising in the menopausal transition.**

The most important questions are whether truly normal women experience an increase in depression during the menopausal transition and whether there are subtle or even clinically apparent psychological problems that identify a susceptible subgroup. In a cross-sectional analysis of the SWAN cohort, it was found that only 5% of women were affected with the “triad” of depressed mood, disturbed sleep, and sexual problems, suggesting that perhaps there is a susceptible group of women predisposed to psychological consequences in menopause.299 Cohort studies support the argument that there is a vulnerable group of women who are at risk for experiencing new-onset depressive symptoms during the menopausal transition. Existing data are consistent with the idea that fluctuations in reproductive hormone levels appear to relate to mood symptoms during the period of menopause transition; however, it is impossible to know if this is a true cause-and-effect relationship. Until such a cause-and-effect relationship is elucidated, current efforts should focus on identifying and treating menopausal women suffering from sleep disturbances related to VMS. Therefore, focusing on a part of this “triad” by improving sleep quality through the reduction of VMS has been successful in improving the quality of life. In a pooled analysis of individual participant data from four randomized, control trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of various interventions for insomnia related to VMS, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was most successful in reducing insomnia symptoms.294 Exercise, venlafaxine, escitalopram, yoga, and estradiol were also effective but less so when compared to CBT.294 One recent small RCT suggested that the

prophylactic use of hormone therapy in women around their FMP may help reduce depressive events. However, they did not assess for previous history of depression and noted a more pronounced effect when patients had more stressful life events in the year of treatment and when hormones were started closer to their FMP.300

**In summary, most women (over 85%) experience the menopausal transition without mood difficulties. Some, however, are at greater risk of new-onset depressive symptoms, and this is probably enhanced by hormonal variations and VMS. This “vulnerable” population is likely derived from a group of premenopausal women with underlying psychological underpinnings. Although it can be hypothesized that the perimenopausal hormone milieu makes an individual less able to deal with adverse events in life, concrete data to support this concept are lacking.**

Attempts to study the effects of estrogen on these problems have been hampered by the subjectivity of the complaints (high placebo responses) and the “domino effect” of what a reduction of hot flushes does toward improvement in sleep quality and this correlation to depression. Using a double-blind crossover prospective study format, Campbell and Whitehead concluded that many symptomatic “improvements” ascribed to estrogen therapy result from relief of hot flushes—a “domino” effect, which has been corroborated by several other studies.152,301,302 In fact, many studies have demonstrated the positive impacts of estrogen therapy on sleep quality, time to sleep, increase in rapid eye movement (REM) time, even in asymptomatic women.303-309 Studies that have been controlled for menopausal symptoms conclude that mood is greatly affected by VMS and sleep disturbances, besides reflecting life problems.152,302

Selection bias is problematic when analyzing the interplay between psychosomatic and VMS. A study of 2,001 Australian women aged 45 to 55 years focused on the utilization of the health care system by women in the perimenopausal period of life.13 Users of the health care system in this age group were frequent previous users of health care, were less healthy, and had more psychosomatic symptoms and vasomotor reactions.13 These women were more likely to have had a significant previous adverse health history, including a prior history of premenstrual complaints. This study emphasized that perimenopausal women who seek health care help are

different from those who do not seek help, and they often embrace hormone therapy in the hope that it will solve their problems. Similar findings have been reported in a cohort of British women.310 It is this population that is seen most often, producing biased opinions among clinicians regarding menopause. We must be careful not to generalize to the entire female population the behavior experienced by a few. Most importantly, menopausal women who present to clinicians often end up being treated with estrogen inappropriately and unnecessarily. Nevertheless, it is well established that a woman’s quality of life is disrupted by VMS and that estrogen therapy provides impressive improvement.311-313 Patients are grateful to be the recipients of this “domino” effect.

The Women’s Health Initiative (WHI; discussed in Chapter 22 under the section “Menopausal Hormone Therapy”) concluded that estrogen-progestin therapy had no beneficial impact on health-related quality of life.314 However, only 12.7% of the participants had moderate to severe VMS at entry to the study, and the symptom burden in this population can be questioned because the participants were willing to take placebo medication. The overall baseline quality of life in this study was relatively high, and the study participants were older (the average number of years distant from menopause was 12+). This randomized, clinical trial did not study the appropriate population of women in order to assess the effect of hormone therapy on measures of quality of life.

The Women’s International Study of Long Duration Oestrogen after the Menopause (WISDOM) trial was a randomized, controlled trial in the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand of 3,721 women aged 50 to 69 treated with either combined 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens to 2.5/5.0 mg medroxyprogesterone or placebo.315 The original plan was to randomize 22,300 women to the study that would last 10 years. The study was canceled in October 2002 in reaction to the initial reports from the WHI. Unfortunately, the premature cancellation precludes the possibility of any long-term data from WISDOM. In the 2,130 women who completed 1 year, there were statistically significant improvements in the treated women in the categories of vasomotor, sexual, and sleep symptoms. Treated women reported a reduction in aching joints and muscles, night sweats, insomnia, and vaginal dryness. The treated group reported more breast tenderness, but the percentages were notably low (16% in the treated group and 7% in the

placebo group), with minimal side effects. In contrast, no differences in depression, anxiety, quality of life, or self-esteem were noted between hormone therapy or placebo. Similar results with VMS, sleep, and joint complaints were actually reported by the WHI, but with a smaller difference between treated and placebo groups. The most important point of these trials (WISDOM, WHI, and HERS; discussed further in Chapter 22\) were all similar in that they all enrolled postmenopausal women heavily tilted toward older asymptomatic women. The authors acknowledged that younger, symptomatic women may have benefit from hormone therapy not seen in an older, asymptomatic population.315

It is a simple and logical conclusion that hormone therapy in a younger, symptomatic group of postmenopausal women would produce greater quality of life benefits than that quantified in the clinical trials. All three clinical trials, therefore, underestimated the beneficial impact because of age and symptom status of their participants. However, in the WISDOM trial, even older postmenopausal women who were symptomatic benefited from hormone therapy. Age should not be the sole guiding factor in decision-making.

Emotional stability during the perimenopausal period can be disrupted by poor sleep patterns. Hot flushing does have an adverse impact on the quality of sleep.303-305 Estrogen therapy improves the quality of sleep, decreasing the time to onset of sleep and increasing the REM sleep time.306,307,311 In the SWAN study, one-third of the women reported sleep problems, even without hot flushes or night sweats, and the prevalence of VMS was associated with an increased risk of sleep disturbances; hormone therapy improved sleep quality.308,309 Perhaps flushing may be insufficient to awaken a woman but sufficient to affect the quality of sleep, thereby diminishing the ability to handle the next day’s problems and stresses. An improvement in sleeping with estrogen treatment can even be documented in postmenopausal women who are reportedly asymptomatic.307

Thus, the overall “quality of life” reported by women can be improved by better sleep and alleviation of hot flushing. However, it is still uncertain whether estrogen treatment has an additional direct pharmacologic antidepressant effect or whether the mood response is totally an indirect benefit of relief from physical symptoms and, consequently, improved sleep. Although multiple studies have seen improvement of depressive

symptoms with hormone therapy with an antidepressant, another cohort study saw no benefit with the use of estrogen therapy.316-321 Utilizing various assessment tools for measuring depression, improvements with estrogen treatment were recorded in oophorectomized women.316,317 In the large prospective cohort study of the Rancho Bernardo retirement community, no benefit could be detected in measures of depression in current users of postmenopausal estrogen compared with untreated women.322 Indeed, treated women had higher depressive symptom scores, presumably reflecting treatment selection bias; symptomatic and depressed women seek hormone therapy. Others report that estrogen therapy has a more powerful impact on women’s well-being beyond the relief of symptoms such as hot flushes.311,318,319 In older depressed women, improvements in response to fluoxetine were enhanced by the addition of estrogen therapy.320 In a 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of 55 perimenopausal women with clinically significant major depression, estradiol treatment with the

100 mg transdermal method significantly improved mood.323 A similar American short-term study of 34 perimenopausal women with both major and minor depressions treated with 50 mg estradiol transdermally demonstrated improvements independently of an effect on VMS.321 Overall, these small clinical trials argue that estrogen treatment is beneficial as an adjunct for the treatment of clinical depression. This conclusion is supported by the successful treatment of postpartum depression with estradiol treatment.324,325

**The most common cause of mood problems is preexisting depression,**9,326 **but there does exist a small population of women whose moods are sensitive to hormonal changes.**9,326,327 In the American SWAN study, the prevalence of mood changes increased from premenopause to early menopause, from about 10% to about 16.5%.326 There are three possible explanations: (1) the decline in estrogen at menopause affects neurotransmitters that regulate mood; (2) mood is adversely affected by VMS (domino theory); and (3) mood is affected by the vicissitudes of life that are commonly prevalent around menopause. Some would argue that these mood swings are in response to the hormonal fluctuations that occur during the perimenopausal years. These fluctuations do indeed occur,70 but whether they cause any symptoms remains to be determined. It seems logical  that  individuals  with  mood  problems  can  reflect  all  these

mechanisms. The menopause transition is full of confounders for depression, such as poor sleep/dyspareunia/vaginal dryness due to estrogen deprivation, and life factors with decreasing personal or partner physical well-being. Thus, it is important to consider all potential contributing factors of depression when treating an individual with peri/postmenopause. **Although the literature has seemed convoluted and is fraught with selection and recall bias, as well as a variety of potential outcomes, existing data have led to a consensus, endorsed by the NAMS, that it does appear that the menopause transition is a time when women are more susceptible to depressive symptoms or a major depressive episode. However, this is more likely in women who have preexisting depression or in those whose moods are sensitive to hormonal changes (such as those with a history of PMS).**9,326

**Cognition, Dementia, Aging, and Menopause**

Cognitive decline and dementia are recognized accompaniments to aging. The role and relevance of female hormones and their deprivation post-menopause has been examined in multiple observational studies as well as in a few RCTs.328 Depending on the method of assessment, evidence for the beneficial effects of estrogen on cognition can be found in the literature, especially in the domain of verbal memory.329,330 However, the effects in healthy women are not impressive and perhaps of little clinical value. A short-term study failed to document an objective improvement in memory, although a slight improvement in mood was recorded.331 Another short-term (3 months) randomized, double-blind study could detect no improvement in cognitive performance compared with placebo treatment.332 The Melbourne Women’s Midlife Health Project could not document an effect on verbal memory during the menopausal transition.333 A longitudinal study in Chicago could not detect a cognitive decline through menopause, as assessed by working memory and perceptual speed.334 The KEEPS cognitive and affective study was an ancillary study to the KEEPS (discussed in more detail in Chapter 22\) that had examined cognitive effects of menopausal hormone therapy when initiated within 3 years of onset of menopause. The parent KEEPS trial examined the *timing hypothesis* from the perspective of CVD, whereas the cognitive ancillary study examined the

timing hypothesis from the perspective of cognition and mood.335 In KEEPS, postmenopausal women within 3 years of the FMP were randomized to oral versus transdermal estrogen versus placebo and were followed for 4 years. The primary outcomes for the cognitive and affective ancillary study included the Modified Mini-Mental State Examination, verbal learning/memory, auditory attention/working memory, visual attention/executive function, speeded language/mental flexibility, and a mood measure (Profile of Mood States).335 KEEPS cognitive study failed to demonstrate any neuroprotective effects of menopausal hormone therapy on the studied cognitive outcomes.

Unlike natural menopause, estrogen treatment of women immediately after bilateral oophorectomy was associated with improvement in certain, but not all, specific tests of memory, and healthy postmenopausal women taking estrogen scored higher on tests of immediate and delayed recall.336-338 In a case-control study of women aged 55 to 93 years, estrogen users had better recall of proper names but no improvement in word recall.339 Women in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging who were using estrogen performed better in tests of visual learning and memory.339-342 In a New York City cohort of women, the use of estrogen was associated with better performance in tests of cognition, and better performance in verbal memory, but the cohort in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures demonstrated no effect of estrogen use on the age-related decline in cognition.342,343 In Connecticut, a randomized, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated better reading ability and verbal memory in the estrogen-treated group of postmenopausal women.344 Perhaps a lack of agreement is due to the variability in test vehicles and the specific aspects of memory function studied. Furthermore, there is impressive individual variability, and when differences have been observed, they have not been large and perhaps of little clinical importance. In addition, any beneficial effects may be attenuated by progestational agents.330

Another possibility for the variable effects of estrogen treatment on cognition is the variability among women in endogenous estrogen levels. Using sensitive assays for free, non-protein-bound estradiol and bioavailable (loosely bound) estradiol, cognitive decline occurred at a greater rate in women with low estradiol levels.345 Studies of cognition may have to differentiate between low- and high-risk women according to

endogenous, biologically active estradiol levels. Similarly, a beneficial effect on cognitive decline has been observed only in women negative for the gene associated with Alzheimer disease, *APOE-*ε*4*, which encodes the ε4 allele of the glycoprotein known as apolipoprotein E, which has, as one of its functions, the shuttling of lipids during neuronal repair.346

Up to 3 times as many women as men develop Alzheimer disease. Estrogen is capable of protecting central nervous system function by means of multiple mechanisms. For example, estrogen protects against neuronal cytotoxicity induced by oxidation; estrogen reduces the serum concentration of amyloid P component (the glycoprotein found in Alzheimer amyloid plaques); and estrogen increases synapses and neuronal growth, especially dendritic spine density.347-349 Estrogen protects against the cerebrovascular toxicity exerted by amyloid peptides and promotes synaptic formation and neuronal growth and survival.350-352 Progestational agents do not exert similar actions.

Case-control and cohort findings indicated that Alzheimer disease and related dementia occurred less frequently (perhaps as much as 60% less) in estrogen users, and the effect was greater with increasing dose and duration of use.353-355 In the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (a prospective cohort), the risk of Alzheimer disease was 54% reduced; in a cohort in New York City, the risk was reduced 60%; and in the Italian Longitudinal Study of Aging, the risk was 72% reduced in estrogen users.356-358 The findings are not uniformly positive; a case-control study with accurate information on clinical diagnoses and estrogen use from the UK General Practice Research Database could detect no impact of estrogen treatment on the risk of developing Alzheimer disease, but the number of estrogen users was very small.359

The short-term administration of unopposed estrogen to patients with Alzheimer disease (secondary prevention) has been reported to improve cognitive performance but mostly to have no effect.360-365 The administration of combinations of estrogen and progestin has also failed to demonstrate a beneficial impact in Alzheimer disease.366 The presence of estrogen therapy has been reported to enhance the beneficial response to tacrine in women with Alzheimer disease,365 but overall, the evidence is consistent with a failure of estrogen to influence already existing Alzheimer disease or other forms of dementia.367

**Although observational data support a primary preventive effect of estrogens, this impression remains unproven by RCT data.** In a prospective cohort study of women living in Cache County, Utah,368 hormone therapy provided about a 41% reduced risk of developing Alzheimer with any use and an 83% reduction with 10 or more years of use. This cohort also demonstrated improved cognition in estrogen users.369 Similarly, other studies have shown a dose and duration dependent relationship between estrogen and Alzheimer disease prevention, with a 54% to 72% reduction in Alzheimer disease with the use of estrogen.353-359 This same reduction, however, was not seen in a small UK study. Most importantly, if women had initiated hormone therapy within a period that encompassed 10 years before the development of clinical symptoms, there was no effect. The Utah study strongly suggested that hormone therapy must be used for a significant duration of time very early in the postmenopausal period to reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease. As neurons become changed by the pathology of dementia, they lose their ability to respond.298 Similarly, a beneficial effect of hormone therapy on cognitive decline was observed only in women negative for *APOE-*ε*4,* the gene associated with Alzheimer disease.346 Divergently, in a subsample of 61 recently menopausal women who had enrolled in the KEEPS RCT (further discussed in Chapter 22), the effect of hormone therapy on β-amyloid protein deposition was studied using positron emission tomography (PET) scan. While there were no differences in baseline characteristics of the subjects, carriers of the *APOE-*ε*4* allele on transdermal estradiol had evidence of reduced β-amyloid protein deposition on PET scan.370 While the sample size is small, KEEPS and other studies’ data suggest that as the neurons change, they lose their ability to respond favorably to estrogen, known as the timing hypothesis.

The importance of timing is supported by findings from the WHI. Women aged 65 years or older who were treated with either estrogen alone or combined estrogen-progestin had an increased risk of impaired cognition and of dementia.371-373 In a subset of these women, MRI scans demonstrated greater brain atrophy in the women receiving hormone therapy.374 The mechanism for this adverse effect of hormonal therapy in old women may be a neurotoxic action because the WHI study with MRI scanning could not detect an increase in ischemic brain lesions.375 Smaller MRI studies of

younger women treated with hormone therapy found beneficial trophic changes in brain morphology, associated with improved cognition.376-378 The mechanism seems to differ by route and formulation of hormone regimen.370 **The theme that emerges is that maintenance of health in target organs by estrogen requires normal tissue, a principle of timing that will also be discussed further in the hormone therapy chapter (Chapter 22). Following the failure of secondary prevention trials to demonstrate a beneficial impact of hormone therapy on coronary disease in older women, it is increasingly argued that estrogen only exerts positive effects in healthy cardiovascular endothelium. A similar argument is made for brain tissue, focusing on biochemical and signaling pathways that do not show improvement with estrogen therapy when they are already compromised with disease.**379 **The requirement for normal tissue, at least in the heart and in the brain, would explain the beneficial effects in studies of primary prevention and the lack of effect**

**in secondary prevention trials.**

### **CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE, AGING, AND MENOPAUSE**

Diseases of the heart are the leading cause of death for women in the United States, followed by cerebrovascular disease and malignant neoplasms. In 2016, one in four female deaths was from CHD compared with one in eight women who develop breast cancer.380 More female deaths in 2016 were caused by CVD than the combined total from cancer, chronic lower respiratory disease, Alzheimer disease, accidents, and diabetes mellitus.

Most CVD results from atherosclerosis in major vessels. Risk factors for CHD are the same for men and women: family history of CVD, high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes mellitus, an abnormal cholesterol/lipoprotein profile, and obesity **(Table 21.6)**. However, when controlling for these risk factors, men prior to age 40 have a risk of developing CHD twice that of women. With increasing age, this advantage is gradually lost, and CVD becomes the leading cause of death for both older women and men.

Total cholesterol	\<200 mg/dL

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol	\>50 mg/dL

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol	\<100 mg/dL

Triglycerides	\<150 mg/dL

CVD, especially atherosclerosis, is a consequence of multiple metabolic changes that interact with each other:

* Adverse changes in the circulating lipid-lipoprotein profile.

* Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), producing a modified LDL that is chemotactic for circulating monocytes and inhibits macrophage motility, trapping then in the intima, which causes cell injury and death in the endothelium.

* Endothelial injury and dysfunction affecting nitric oxide and prostacyclin production.

* Macrophage migration and functions, influenced by growth factors and cytokines.

* Proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells also influenced by growth factors and cytokines; these cells become the dominant cell type and the source of the connective tissue matrix in the atherosclerotic lesion, the fibrous plaque.

* Vasoconstriction and thrombogenic events.

* Remodeling of coronary arteries. An artery is able to respond to a developing atherosclerotic plaque by increasing its overall diameter in an attempt to maintain flow.381

The mechanism of this adaptive remodeling is not known, but the extent of this process does affect the risk of occlusion and infarction.

There is an established sequence of events leading to atherosclerosis **(Figure 21.11)**. The process starts with endothelial dysfunction that leads to the fatty streak in arterial vessels, the precursor to clinically significant

lesions. The fatty streak lesion, therefore, antedates the fibrous plaque, developing under the endothelial surface and dominated by fat-laden macrophages (the foam cells). The damaged endothelium expresses cytokines, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory agents that are involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. The formation of a plaque is initiated by the aggregation and adherence of circulating monocytes (macrophages) to a site on the arterial endothelium, stimulating an inflammatory response. When the monocytes penetrate through the endothelium and enter the intima, they become loaded with lipids and converted to foam cells. Modification of LDL, especially oxidation, is crucial in this conversion of monocytes to foam cells. The adherence of monocytes to endothelium can be induced by elevated cholesterol and LDL cholesterol in the circulation. Most of the cholesterol that accumulates in atherosclerotic plaques is derived from circulating LDL cholesterol. As plaques become significant in size, they are prone to instability, rupturing, and creating a prothrombotic state. Matrix metalloproteinase enzymes are secreted by inflammatory cells and smooth muscle cells. These enzymes digest the proteins in the fibrous cap of an atherosclerotic plaque, making the plaque unstable and predisposed to rupture. **Estrogen induces matrix metalloproteinase production or activity, which digests the fibrous cap of a plaque, exposing the underlying thrombogenic collagen, and this is believed to be the mechanism involved in the adverse thrombotic effects of estrogen in the presence of established atherosclerosis.**382 **In addition, 27-hydroxycholesterol, a cholesterol metabolite elevated in atherosclerotic lesions, competitively antagonizes estrogen receptor activity in cardiovascular epithelium.**383

**FIGURE 21.11**

During the reproductive years, women are “protected” from CHD. Women lag men in the incidence of CHD by 10 years, and for myocardial

infarction and sudden death, women have a 20-year advantage. The reasons for this are complex, but a significant contribution to this protection can be assigned to the higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels in younger women, an effect of estrogen and lower levels of testosterone. Throughout adulthood, the blood HDL cholesterol level is about 10 mg/dL higher in women, and this difference continues through the postmenopausal years. Total and LDL cholesterol levels are lower in premenopausal women than in men, although the levels gradually increase with aging and after menopause they rise rapidly.384-388 After menopause, the risk of CHD doubles for women as the atherogenic lipids at about age 60 reach levels greater than those in men. These changes can be favorably reduced by dietary modifications.389,390 Of course, These lipid changes *at* menopause (whether natural or surgical) can be reversed with estrogen treatment.391

Prospective studies have documented the strong association between total cholesterol and CHD in women, although CHD risk appears at higher total cholesterol levels for women than for men.392,393 Women with total cholesterol concentrations greater than 265 mg/dL have rates of CHD 3 times that of women with lower levels. Even in older women, a high total cholesterol remains a significant predictor of heart disease, but the strength of association between the cholesterol level and CVD decreases with aging, and by age 80, the cost and benefits may not justify cholesterol intervention.394 This is the reason for ceasing lipoprotein screening after age

75 in patients with normal lipids. However, this decision should be individualized, taking into account the vigor and health of the patient.

The strongest predictor of CHD in women is a low HDL cholesterol.392,393,395 The average HDL cholesterol in women is approximately 55 to 60 mg/dL. A decrease in HDL cholesterol of 10 mg/dL increases CHD risk by 40% to 50%. In women (and men) who had normal total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, but low HDL cholesterol levels, treatment with lovastatin can reduce the risk of an acute major coronary event by approximately 37%.396 High HDL cholesterol levels are uncommon in women with CHD, but even women with high levels do develop CHD.397 **Because of the increased risk of CHD observed in individuals with low HDL, it is appropriate to be concerned when HDL cholesterol levels are less than 50 mg/dL.** It should be emphasized that modest  elevations  in  blood  pressure  markedly  increase  the  overall
