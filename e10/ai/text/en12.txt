between placebo groups and the estradiol groups for early or late menopause status.808

Thus, unlike KEEPS, results of the ELITE trial support the timing hypothesis in that early initiation (ie, closer to the timing of menopause) of HT was associated with more favorable cardiovascular outcomes. The differences between ELITE and KEEPS may, among many possibilities, relate to inherent differences in the studied populations or reflect differences in the choice and dose of estrogen formulations utilized.463,809

## Key Points: Hormones and Coronary Heart Disease

**The message from multiple secondary prevention trials is clear: Exogenous estrogen should be avoided in postmenopausal women with existing CHD, and there are no grounds for an expectation that such treatment will reduce subsequent cardiac events.**  
**Evidence from primary prevention clinical trials, while less clear, suggests that early initiation of estrogen may confer cardioprotective effects** (**as evident in the ELITE trial**)**; however, additional studies are needed to establish consistency of such a benefit across populations and to clarify if such benefit may depend on the type and dose of estrogen formulation, given the discrepant findings between ELITE and KEEPS trials. Until clarity is attained, cardioprotection alone should not be used as an indication for prescribing HT.**  
**A reasonable goal is to maintain a healthy level of estrogen during the premenopausal years and in the early postmenopausal period.**  
**Experimental evidence in the monkey indicates that the beneficial effects of hormonal treatment are progressively diminished with increasing atherosclerosis.**463  
**In postmenopausal women, the vasodilatory effects of estrogen dissipate with**

**increasing age.**809

### **VENOUS THROMBOSIS**

Results from multiple studies indicate that postmenopausal HT increases the risk of VTE about 2-fold, mostly in the first year or 2 years of treatment,

a conclusion supported by the results from the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI.766,810 The absolute risk in the WHI estrogen-progestin arm was 18 additional cases per 10,000 women per year. In the estrogen-only arm of the WHI, a smaller increase in deep vein thrombosis was observed, and an increase in pulmonary embolism was not statistically significant.767,811 There are some notable observations in the WHI data on venous thrombosis. Most of the cases occurred in the first 2 years of exposure, and the risk was greatest in the women over age 70 and in women who are overweight. The risk was higher in women who were susceptible to venous thrombosis, specifically those with the Leiden mutation. This raises a very important question: Is it possible that the risk of venous thrombosis is very low in younger, normal postmenopausal women?

**It should be emphasized that the risk of VTE appears to apply only to new hormone starters; women who have been on HT can be reassured that the evidence indicates that the increased risk of venous thrombosis is concentrated in the first 1 to 2 years of treatment.**658 **The actual risk is very low because of the low frequency of this event. If the RR is increased 2-fold, this would increase the incidence of VTE by about two cases per 10,000 women per year of hormone use. Furthermore, venous thrombosis carries with it a very low risk of mortality, around 1%, and most of the fatal cases have followed venous thrombosis associated with trauma, surgery, or a major illness.**812

VTE is a risk that is reduced with the use of statins and low-dose aspirin,813,814 although it is not known whether statin and aspirin use would completely protect against the increased risk associated with postmenopausal use of HT.

Accruing data are reassuring regarding lesser VTE risk with the transdermal route of estrogen compared to oral use, a benefit that is attributed to avoidance of the first-pass hepatic effect with the nonoral route. For example, oral administration of estrogen compared with transdermal administration in male-to-female transsexuals is associated with a greater prothrombotic state and risk of venous thrombosis; however, this effect could be at least partly attributed to major differences in the estrogen doses.815 It would be better to have evidence uninfluenced by dosage, and for this purpose, we can consider responses of APC resistance, recognized as a marker for venous thrombosis risk. In one randomized trial,

oral estrogen treatment increased APC resistance, but transdermal estrogen was no different than placebo.40 Another randomized trial found that both routes of administration increased APC resistance; however, the increase with oral estrogen was about 4 times greater compared with transdermal estrogen.39 A French case-control study concluded that there was a 4-fold increase in VTE with current use of oral estrogen, but no increase in risk with transdermal estrogen.41 In addition, this study reported that oral estrogen treatment adds to the risk of VTE associated with obesity, but transdermal estrogen does not.816 The French study also reported (although limited by small numbers) that transdermal treatment, in contrast to oral estrogen, does not further increase the risk of VTE associated with known prothrombotic conditions, such as factor V Leiden deficiency or prothrombin mutations.42

However, there are some problems with the French case-control study. There are wide CIs for the significant OR associated with oral estrogen treatment. Usually, this reflects small numbers, but the number of cases and controls in this study should allow greater precision. It is possible that this imprecise conclusion is influenced by the fact that the cases and controls differed significantly in several characteristics that influence the risk of VTE, specifically greater body weight and a positive family history of VTE. We know that a 2-fold increased risk of VTE is uniformly reported, including the data from the WHI.810,811 It is very likely that the French estimate is higher compared with the usual 2-fold increased risk because of confounding differences between their cases and controls. **It is worth noting again that in the WHI, the cases of venous thrombosis were concentrated in the first years of exposure, in the oldest, and in the heaviest women in the study.**

The French case-control study found no increase in VTE risk associated with estrogen combined with progesterone or pregnane derivatives and an increase with norpregnane derivatives. The pregnane group includes synthetic progestins, such as MPA, chlormadinone, and cyproterone. The norpregnanes (progesterone without the 19-carbon) included two progestins, nomegestrol acetate and promegestone, that are not used in the United States. (Nomegestrol acetate is the progestin in Uniplant, a single-rod implant contraceptive, and combined with estradiol in an oral contraceptive.) However, can we make the conclusion that the norpregnanes

are thrombogenic? The CI in the norpregnane group was very wide, again apparently not due to small numbers, but this makes this conclusion shaky and suspect. Similar results were reported from the E3N French prospective cohort study, with an increased risk of VTE of 1.7 (CI \= 1.1-2.8) associated with current users of oral therapy (an HR more in keeping with the usual 2-fold increase reported in the literature) and no increase with transdermal estrogen.45 Again, an increase was observed with norpregnane progestins, this time with tighter CIs. In contrast, several other studies have demonstrated an increased VTE risk in women using medroxyprogesterone.817

In the French studies, oral hormone users used almost exclusively estradiol in doses that averaged 1.5 mg/d. Transdermal users most commonly used an estradiol dose of 50 μg or less daily. To legitimately compare oral and transdermal methods, one would have to be sure the two groups had similar blood levels, to account for the wide variation in metabolism and clearance among individuals. It is possible that the difference between the oral and transdermal groups represents differences in estrogen doses. Nevertheless, the French conclusions are supported by a very large case-control study (23,505 cases of VTE) using the UK General Practice Research Database.305 The use of transdermal estrogen either alone or combined with a progestin was not associated with an increase in VTE, compared with about a 1.5-fold increase with oral estrogen alone and oral estrogen-progestin.

A greater safety with transdermal administration of estrogen with regard to VTE makes some sense because of the known lesser impact on clotting proteins when the first-pass liver effect is avoided. This is supported by transdermal estrogen’s almost negligible effect on APC resistance when compared with oral therapy.39,818 A randomized trial assessing the risk of recurrent VTE in women with a prior history of thrombosis being treated with an oral hormone regimen was canceled after 1 year when eight women in the treated group developed recurrent venous thrombosis compared with only one in the placebo group.819 The eight women were studied retrospectively, and six of the eight had an inherited susceptibility to venous thrombosis. The numbers were not large, but the results are a strong argument for the recommendations detailed in Chapter 22\. There is no argument that inherited abnormalities in the clotting scheme increase the

risk for VTE. The evidence is mixed for arterial thrombosis, but most of the evidence fails to find an association between specific inherited defects (thrombophilia) and arterial thrombosis, although this is still unsettled.820-823 If a patient has a close family history (parent or sibling, or child) or a previous episode of idiopathic thromboembolism, an evaluation to search for an underlying abnormality in the coagulation system is warranted before exposing the patient to exogenous HT. The following measurements are recommended,		and	abnormal	results		require	consultation	with	a hematologist	regarding	prognosis	and	consideration	for	prophylactic treatment with an anticoagulant. The list of laboratory tests is long, and, because this is a dynamic and changing field, the best advice is to consult with a hematologist (**Table 22.8**). When a diagnosis of a hereditary thrombotic tendency is made, screening should be offered to other family

members.

Antithrombin III deficiency	Antithrombin III Protein C deficiency	Protein C

Anticardiolipin antibodies

Other risk factors for thromboembolism that should be considered by clinicians include an acquired predisposition, such as the presence of lupus anticoagulant or malignancy, obesity, immobility, or trauma. Varicose veins are not a risk factor unless they are very extensive, and, unlike arterial thrombosis, smoking either has no effect or at best is a weak risk factor for VTE. Raloxifene (and tamoxifen) shares with estrogen an increased risk for VTE.215 The size of the risk is comparable for all three drugs, about a 2-fold increase.

## Key Points: Hormone Therapy and Venous Thromboembolism

**Observational studies support the clinical choice of a transdermal method for women who are at higher risk for VTE and for whom menopausal HT is being considered due to failure of symptom benefit from nonhormonal strategies.**  
**Although existing data are overall reassuring regarding safety of progestin regimens commonly used in menopause hormone regimens, an absence of good data does not allow making any statements with confidence regarding an absence of thrombogenic risk for the various progestins. However, it may be prudent to consider transdermal E2 with micronized progesterone** (**in women with a uterus**) **in those deemed at risk for VTE until RCTs confirm/refute the safety of alternative progestogens.**817 **The clinician and patient can together consider a combination of**  
**HT** (**preferably transdermal administration**) **and chronic anticoagulation, in consultation with a hematologist.**  
**We recommend appropriate prophylactic anticoagulant treatment in hormone users anticipating immobility with hospitalization, especially if other risk factors** (**most notably, obesity**) **are present. Some patients may elect to discontinue hormone treatment 4 weeks prior to major surgery if extended immobility is to be expected, but this is an empiric, individual decision. HT can be resumed when the patient is ambulatory.**

### **BREAST CANCER AND MENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY**

Women and clinicians are regularly reminded about the threat of breast cancer, in the media, by advertisements, and by the experience of a friend or family member fighting this disease. Breast cancer is a major focus in the health concerns and care for postmenopausal women because it has an increasing frequency with age. About 95% of all breast cancers and 97% of breast cancer deaths in the United States occur in women over age 40\.824 Thus, there are good reasons why this medical condition is a prominent factor in clinical decision-making regarding postmenopausal HT.

The long-term use of postmenopausal HT has been challenged by data that have been interpreted to indicate that the risk of breast cancer is increased in hormone users. The debate and publicity over this issue have made decision-making very difficult for both patients and clinicians. **The most important unanswered question is whether postmenopausal HT initiates the growth of new breast cancers or whether the epidemiologic results reflect an impact on preexisting tumors.**

**Biologic Plausibility**

The most compelling reason to believe that long-term use of postmenopausal estrogen increases the risk of breast cancer is the inherent biologic plausibility. Factors known to increase a woman’s exposure to estrogen are known to increase the risk of breast cancer; for example, there is a small decrease in risk with late menarche and a moderate increase in risk with late natural menopause.825 In premenopausal women who are overweight, the risk of breast cancer is lower compared with normal weight individuals, and in postmenopausal women, excess weight is associated with either an unchanged or slightly increased risk.826-828 This is attributed to an increase in total and free estrogen levels in postmenopausal women who overweight, in contrast to lower levels with increasing weight in premenopausal women. Postmenopausal women who are obese have later menopause, higher estrone production rates and higher free estradiol levels (lower SHBG), and a slightly greater risk for breast cancer.829 Greater bone density, believed to be a marker for estrogen exposure, is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.830-832

Studies seeking a correlation between circulating levels of sex hormones and breast cancer have yielded conflicting results. In the Rancho

Bernardo cohort, no relationship between estrogen, androgen, and SHBG levels and the incidence of breast cancer could be demonstrated.833 Using serum collected earlier in life, no differences in endogenous hormones could be detected in 51 women who subsequently developed breast cancer, including the various estrogens, progesterone, androstenedione, and even SHBG.834 On the other hand, in a very large prospective study in Italy, estradiol, testosterone, and SHBG levels were higher in postmenopausal women who subsequently developed breast cancer.835 In a British report, women who subsequently developed breast cancer had higher levels of estradiol.836 Two North American prospective studies also found higher levels of estrogen in women who subsequently developed breast cancer, and most impressively, an increasing risk of breast cancer correlated with increasing levels of free estradiol.837,838 In another study, women who developed breast cancer displayed higher levels of unbound, free estradiol and lower levels of SHBG.839 In the Nurses’ Health Study, an association was reported between an increased risk of breast cancer and higher levels of estradiol, estrone, and DHEA-S, whereas no association could be demonstrated with the percent free or bioavailable levels of estradiol, androstenedione, testosterone, or DHEA.840 **The discrepancies among the various studies seeking a correlation between hormone blood levels and the risk of breast cancer reflect the fact that the differences are very small, and it is a struggle to achieve statistical significance.**

Overall, the biologic plausibility for an estrogen link with breast cancer is an impressive argument. This argument is further strengthened by the proven benefit of reducing the incidence of breast cancer with the antiestrogen, tamoxifen. However, establishing a clinically real cause-and-effect relationship with epidemiologic data requires more than the rationale of biologic plausibility.

**Results From Observational Studies**

In the past decade, a large number of case-control and cohort studies indicated a slightly increased risk of breast cancer with postmenopausal use of HT. Overall, most of these studies indicated a greater risk associated with estrogen-progestin compared with unopposed estrogen treatment.841-857

***A Reanalysis of the World’s Literature***

Prior to the publications from the WHI, the 1997 report of a reanalysis of the world’s literature was the most referenced article on this subject. A team of epidemiologists invited all investigators who had previously studied the association of postmenopausal hormone use and the risk of breast cancer (51 studies) to submit their original data for a collaborative combined reanalysis, an undertaking more rigorous than a standard meta-analysis. This analysis reached the following conclusions858:

* Ever users of menopausal hormones had an overall increased RR of breast cancer of 1.14.

* Current users for 5 years or more had an RR of 1.35 (CI \= 1.21-1.49), and the risk increased with increasing duration of use.

* Current and recent users had evidence of having only localized disease (no metastatic disease), and ever users had less metastatic disease.

* There was no effect of a family history of breast cancer.

This was the first important indication that women with a positive family history of breast cancer do not have a further increase in risk with HT, a finding also reported in the WHI.859 There were two other notable conclusions: All of the increase in risk was localized disease, and women who used HT and developed breast cancer had better survival rates than nonusers; these observations have been repeatedly confirmed.

***The Million Women Study***

The Million Women Study recruited 1,084,110 women between 1996 and 2001 from those invited by the UK National Health Service Breast Screening Programme to have screening mammography every 3 years (about half had ever used postmenopausal HT).852 The study data were recorded from questionnaires returned prior to the initial mammography, and the women were followed to determine cancer incidence and death. The study is noteworthy for its large numbers and adjustments for the well-recognized factors associated with risk of breast cancer. No increase in the risk of breast cancer was measured in past users of any hormone preparation, regardless of the length of time since discontinuation, from less than 5 to 10 years or more (with the exception of discontinuation in the year previous to diagnosis), and regardless of the duration of use. Based on an average follow-up of 2.6 years (a very short exposure; indeed, the breast cancers were diagnosed on an average of 1.2 years after the study began), the RR for invasive breast cancer in current users of estrogen only was 1.30 (CI \= 1.22-1.38) and for current users of estrogen-progestin was 2.00 (CI \= 1.91-2.09).

There are many criticisms of the Million Women Study. For example, the study reported a lower risk of breast cancer for perimenopausal and postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women despite the well-established fact that breast cancer risk increases with aging. There were many differences comparing users and nonusers, requiring multiple adjustments. Hormone use or nonuse was established at entry and not changed during follow-up despite multiple crossovers in treatment among the women. Validation of the questionnaire data was claimed based on information obtained from only 570 women. Breast cancer mortality was assessed after an average of 4.1 years of follow-up, based on a total of 517 deaths; however, breast cancer was diagnosed very rapidly (an average of 1.2 years), and deaths occurred swiftly (within an average of 1.7 years). Current users and past users were compared with the never users, and, although the risk of mortality was increased, it did not reach statistical significance (1.22; CI \= 1.00-1.48). This finding was highlighted because it differed with a consistent story reported in the literature over a decade that hormone users  had  better  survival  rates.  The  Million  Women  Study

calculated their risk of mortality by dividing deaths from breast cancer by the total number of users or nonusers. When the data are recalculated appropriately by dividing deaths from breast cancer by the total number of cases of breast cancer in the user and nonuser groups, the results agree with the literature—**the risk of mortality was reduced about 27% in the hormone users.**

***The Danish Nurse Cohort***

The Danish Nurse Cohort of 10,874 women was established in 1993\.860 The results reflected a variety of hormone products and regimens, and an increased HR for breast cancer was associated with HT (HR \= 2.42; CI \= 1.81-3.26), with a 2-fold increase in breast cancer mortality. Stated simply, hormone users had a greater mortality rate from breast cancer because they had more breast cancers. Even though the case fatality rate was better (more favorable prognosis), the increased incidence produced a net effect of an increase in mortality.

Danish case-control and cohort studies are noted for their ability to accurately obtain information from the national registries. Nevertheless, there were important limitations to this study. The most glaring problem was that not all causes of death could be verified and a death in a woman with a diagnosis of breast cancer was assumed to be a breast cancer death. The authors state that this problem would be balanced by similar numbers in the user and nonuser groups, but this is an assumption. In this population of older women, one would expect deaths from other causes to outnumber deaths from breast cancer. This single assumption by the epidemiologists could have skewed the results.

In addition, the case fatality and breast cancer mortality calculations were adjusted only for age. The authors stated that a relatively small number of deaths precluded multiple adjusting. However, there are so many factors that influence the risk of breast cancer, including age of menarche, age at menopause, age at first full-term pregnancy, parity and age at diagnosis, use of mammography, presence of benign breast disease (specifically with atypical hyperplasia), body size, and alcohol intake How can we know that the results did not reflect an imbalance in some of these factors?

***Hormone Therapy and Lobular Breast Cancer***

A population-based, case-control study adds to the previous reports from this Seattle group of epidemiologists focusing on the relationship between postmenopausal HT and the histologic subtype of breast cancer.861 The main conclusions are an increased risk of tumors of the lobular type or with a lobular component and an increase in the OR that appeared with 3 or more years of use with combined estrogen-progestin therapy. Similar results were reported in Swedish and German case-control studies.855,862

It is a logical conclusion that the results reflect increasing proportions of hormonally sensitive tissue. Lobular tumors are characteristically ER-positive and more hormone sensitive. If HT is affecting preexisting tumors, one would expect the hormonally sensitive lobular cancers to be detected earlier.

**The Women’s Health Initiative**

The impression gained from the observational data concluding that exposure to estrogen-progestin was more harmful was reinforced when clinicians were confronted by the results in the prematurely stopped estrogen and progestin (CEE+MPA) arm of the WHI.863 Invasive breast cancer was increased, 199 cases in the treated group and 150 in the placebo group (HR \= 1.24; CI \= 1.01-1.54). The absolute risk was four to six additional cancers per 10,000 women per year. The  WHI  performed

subgroup analyses focusing on how prior HT use influenced the risk of breast cancer found in the estrogen-progestin trial arm.864 Prior hormone users totaled 4,311 participants (26%), with 42% reporting less than 2 years

of use (17% used hormones 5-10 years previously and 26% \>10 years before enrolling in the WHI study). Prior users had an increased HR compared to placebo (1.96; CI \= 1.17-3.27) in contrast to no increase among never-users (1.02; CI \= 0.77-1.36). The WHI concluded that this difference could reflect an increasing risk with cumulative exposure to HT.

Many of the factors associated with the risk of breast cancer were slightly but significantly more prevalent in the group of prior hormone users in the WHI, such as younger age, more education, lower body mass, more physical activity, smoking, alcohol use, VMS, and lower bone density. The overall risk of breast cancer in the treated estrogen-progestin group was the same as previously reported by the WHI (1.24; CI \= 1.02-1.50).863 However, after adjusting for the multiple factors recognized to influence the risk of breast cancer, *the HR was 1.20 and no longer statistically significant* (*CI* \= *0.94–1.53*)*.* The placebo group failed to demonstrate an age-related increase in risk over the duration of the trial, and the treatment group and the placebo group differed in regard to breast cancer risk factors, creating a need for the investigators to perform multiple adjustments. Why did not the randomization of large numbers avoid this confounding problem? **The strength		of	the	WHI	conclusion	is	limited	by	the	fact	that	the participants in the treatment and placebo groups differed considerably.** Results in the second estrogen-only arm of the WHI, which too was prematurely stopped, failed to detect an increase in breast cancer risk associated with estrogen-alone use (RR \= 0.80; 95% CI \= 0.62-1.04).865 Furthermore, a statistically significantly decreased risk of breast cancer was noted in the CEE group compared to placebo in the postintervention phase (HR	\=	0.77;		95%	CI		\=	0.62-0.95).866,867	In	 addition,		there	was	a significantly lower mortality risk from breast cancer in the estrogen-treated group compared to placebo (HR \= 0.37; 95% CI \= 0.13-0.91).867 This striking difference between the CEE+MPA versus CEE-alone arms of WHI led many to conclude that exposure to progestin (MPA) may be causative to the exaggerated breast cancer risk that was observed only in the CEE+MPA arm of WHI hormone trials. A longitudinal median of 20-year follow-up on the WHI cohort was published in 2020, wherein not only the earlier

observed risk reduction in breast cancer in the CEE-alone hormone trial persisted, but a lasting reduced mortality from breast cancer was also evident in postmenopausal participants of the WHI E-alone hormone trial.868 Conversely, the slightly higher risk of breast cancer that was apparent at the termination of the WHI E+P trial was noted to persist at 20-year follow-up, although reassuringly there was no evidence of increased mortality in participants of the WHI E+P trial. Despite the discrepant incidence of breast cancer in the two WHI hormone trials, it must be emphasized that the populations participating in the two trials differed considerably, such that it is not appropriate to simply conclude that the differences in breast cancer risk can be attributed to the effects of progestin exposure. Even the WHI investigators cautioned clinicians to avoid comparing the two trial arms because the participants in the two arms differed noticeably.768 In regard to breast cancer risk, women in the estrogen-only arm had a higher rate of previous exposure to hormones and longer durations of prior use. It is possible that earlier and greater use of HT before participation in the study identified those individuals with preexisting tumors who were then excluded from participation, accounting for the lower incidence of breast cancer in the treated group. **The breast cancer results in the WHI do not allow us to answer the important question whether exposure to estrogen-progestin has a greater risk of breast cancer or whether preexisting tumors respond differently to the various hormone regimens, accounting for differences in epidemiologic reports. This is further addressed later in this chapter.**

### **BREAST CANCER RISK AND DURATION OF HORMONE USE**

A cohort study assessed the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal Finnish women using oral, transdermal, and vaginal estrogen-only or estrogen-progestin products containing either estradiol or estriol.869,870 The use of estradiol for 5 years or more and the use of estrogen-progestin for 3 years or more were associated with a statistically significant increased risk. The risk was similar when comparing oral and transdermal therapy. An increase was observed in both localized and metastatic diseases. A statistically significant increase was noted with carcinoma in situ.

Only 7% of Finnish postmenopausal women used HT for more than 5 years. This study reported an increase in breast cancer risk in this long-term user group of women. No increase in breast cancer risk was detected either in association with estriol given orally or with vaginal estrogen products. However, it is inappropriate to conclude that these formulations can be used without risk. To make this conclusion, users and nonusers of these formulations would have to be comparable in terms of breast cancer risk factors and in terms of bioequivalent blood levels of estrogen. Only then could a valid comparison be made. This study could not adjust for these factors.

The use of postmenopausal HT in Finland can be accurately recorded because all treatments must be prescribed and then paid for by the National Social Insurance Institution. However, the study is affected by an overwhelming problem: The results are questionable because of an inability to control for confounders. The risk was expressed as incidence ratios, calculated by dividing the observed number of cases by the numbers expected (based on the general statistics in Finland). Therefore, the study could not be controlled for confounders. Risk ratios less than 2.0 can easily be inaccurate because they can reflect confounding factors. It is well demonstrated that hormone users differ when compared to nonusers in terms of recognized risk factors for breast cancer. The differences also include a greater prevalence of mammography among hormone users. A good example can be found in the report from the Nurses’ Health Study that, like the cohort from Finland, indicated an increased risk of breast cancer with long-term users of estrogen only.871 The long-term HT users in the Nurses’ Health Study had more bilateral salpingo-oophorectomies, more nulliparity, more benign breast disease, and greater alcohol consumption, and they were thinner—all factors that make a comparison of HT users to nonusers very difficult.

In order to minimize the problem of confounders, the Finnish report argued that “there are no socioeconomic differences between postmenopausal hormone therapy users and the general population in Finland,” citing a previous report. This statement is not totally accurate. The previous report in 1999 was based on population surveys and measured only two things: length of education and rural versus urban living.872 A lack of educational differences was present in Finnish women under the age of

55, but older postmenopausal women had more years of education. In addition, there were regional differences at all ages, with the current use of HT being most common in the Helsinki area (especially among older women). Therefore, the 1999 study does not imply a lack of differences in hormone users in Finland, in fact, just the opposite. Age information is not provided in the reports on breast cancer, but the longer term hormone users were probably an older group of women, and according to the 1999 Finnish report, they do differ when compared to the general population of Finland. Remember, this cohort study is not comparing users with nonusers. It compares users to general population statistics. Therefore, we cannot know whether the results of this study reflect long-term use of estrogen or whether the results reflect a greater prevalence of risk factors and mammography in the hormone-using group (see **Table 22.7**).

**Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer Outcome**

Long-term use of HT increases the risk of breast cancer, yet cause-and-effect mechanisms are unclear. In the WHI trials, estrogen plus progestin use showed increased risk, while use of estrogen alone did not result in added risk for breast cancer. This disparity in results of the two WHI hormone trials raised concerns that progestin may be the culprit in causing breast cancer in hormone-using menopausal women. Most of the studies that have examined breast cancer mortality rates of women who had used postmenopausal HT at the time of diagnosis have documented improved survival rates.720,731,739,873-882 Even a study that indicated a reduction in mammographic sensitivity also reported smaller, more differentiated tumors among the users compared with the nonusers.336 Evidence indicates that hormone users develop smaller, better-differentiated (lower grade), and lower-stage tumors, evidence that is consistent with the effects on preexisting tumors and that surveillance/detection bias is not the only explanation for better survival.851,881-899 Lower-grade tumors are present even when there is no difference in the prevalence of mammography comparing hormone users and nonusers or when the data are adjusted for the method of detection.877,879,890,900 This is not a totally uniform story, in that at least one prospective study concluded that estrogen-progestin users had both lower and higher stage and grade tumors.851 However, nearly all

reports indicate that more tumors in hormone users are detected by screening mammography, and when assessing outcomes in all cancers detected by mammography, hormone users have more ductal in situ tumors, more node-negative cancers, smaller tumors, and less invasive disease and, thus, better survival rates.882,895
