findings, caution is advised in interpreting these results, given the limited statistical power.101

***Management of Urinary Symptoms***

Several recent studies have analyzed the effect of vaginal ET on various bladder-related problems seen in postmenopausal women. A small RCT of

35 women had a statistically significant reduction in UTIs in women randomized to vaginal estrogen (cream or tablet) versus placebo.102 A large retrospective cohort study of 5,600 women with hypoestrogenism demonstrated effectiveness of vaginal estrogen for the prevention of recurrent UTIs.103

***Standard-Dose Method***

One vaginal ring formulation (Femring, estradiol acetate) releases 50 or 100-μg estradiol acetate per day over a 3-month time span.104,105 Estradiol acetate is a prohormone, which is rapidly hydrolyzed to estradiol, which is reflected in blood estradiol levels similar to those achieved with oral and transdermal methods. The systemic levels achieved with either dose formulation effectively suppress VMS, and a beneficial impact on bone is expected. Unlike other estrogen vaginal formulations, Femring is FDA-approved not only for the management of moderate-to-severe vulvovaginal symptoms attributable to hypoestrogenism but also for VMS-related bother. **This vaginal ring should not be considered local vaginal therapy, and users require the addition of a progestational agent for endometrial protection in the presence of a uterus.**

**Role of Monitoring Blood Levels of Estradiol in Estrogen Users**

**Monitoring the estradiol blood level in postmenopausal women does not have a role in routine management**. However, in women not responding to standard HT dosing, it may be beneficial to assess serum estradiol levels. Monitoring, however, is not as straightforward as it would seem. There are two primary difficulties. First, the clinical assays available differ considerably in their technique and quality (laboratory and antibody variations). Second, the various commercial products represent a diverse collection of estrogenic compounds, ranging from estradiol to unique

equine estrogens. Although the body interconverts various estrogens into estrone and estradiol, is this process relatively consistent within and between individuals? A highly specific assay for estradiol will detect very low levels of estradiol in women receiving 0.625-mg CEEs; nevertheless, most clinical assays will report a level of 40 to 100 pg/mL in these women.

We find measurement of blood estradiol levels very useful in selected patients, such as the patient who requests ever-increasing doses of estrogen for the treatment of symptoms, which, in the presence of very high blood levels of estradiol, can be confidently diagnosed as psychosomatic. What each clinician must do is learn what blood level of estradiol as performed by the local laboratory is associated with the standard doses of HT (0.625-mg conjugated estrogens, 1-mg estradiol, 50-μg transdermal estradiol) and consistently use the same laboratory. This range is 40 to 100 pg/mL estradiol when the estrogen is taken the evening before the office visit (with transdermal administration, blood sampling should be obtained the day before new patch placement); the range reflects individual variation, including the variability from peak to nadir values. **Remember that because follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) is also regulated by a factor other than estrogen** (**ie, inhibin**)**, FSH levels cannot be used to monitor estrogen dosage.** Menopausal HT utilizing commonly prescribed regimens will produce only a 10% to 20% decrease in FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), and there is great individual variability in the responses.106

**Products containing EE** (**commonly used in combined hormonal contraceptives**) **will not affect the measurement of circulating estradiol levels.** EE circulates without being changed, and the antibodies in the immunoassays for estradiol will not recognize it. It is for this reason that women on oral contraceptives have very low measurements of estradiol. However, given the higher estrogenic potency of EE and hence a higher potential for adverse effects such as VTE compared to that of estradiol,107 this aspect should be taken into consideration when choosing a hormone regimen (such as a combined hormonal contraceptive) for perimenopausal and menopausal women.

**Menopausal Hormone Therapy: Sequential and Continuous Regimens**

Postmenopausal HT initially consisted only of sequential regimens that were logical reflections of the cyclic estrogen and progesterone patterns in a premenopausal menstrual cycle. Clinical trials established the doses and durations for progestin administration that would effectively protect the endometrium against unchecked estrogen-driven proliferation.108 Progestin withdrawal bleeding occurs in 80% to 90% of women on a sequential regimen.109-111 The continuous combined method of treatment evolved to improve patient continuance that was adversely affected by bleeding and other symptoms triggered by the cyclic hormonal changes. The addition of a daily dose of a progestin to the daily administration of estrogen allowed the progestin dose to be smaller, provided effective protection against endometrial hyperplasia, and resulted in amenorrhea within 1 year of treatment in 80% to 90% of patients.110,112-114

In the sequential regimen, estrogen is administered daily, and progestins are administered for 2 weeks every month, using the *comparable* doses of the progestogens shown in the following list and those that are listed in **Table 22.3**111-116:

* 5-mg medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA)

* 1.0-mg norethindrone acetate (NETA)

* 200-mg micronized progesterone

In the daily continuous, combined regimen, progestins are combined with estrogen in the following *comparable* doses113,114,117:

1.5 or 2.5-mg MPA

* 0.35-mg norethindrone

0.5 or 1.0-mg NETA

* 100-mg micronized progesterone

* 2-mg drospirenone (DRSP)

* 2-mg dienogest

**Menopausal Hormone Therapy: *Estrogen Dose***

There has been a progressive decrease in estrogen doses in menopausal HT regimens. For many years, the standard doses of estrogens were 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens, 1 to 2-mg micronized estradiol, 1- to 2-mg estradiol valerate, or equivalent doses of other estrogens such as 5-μg EE. Lower doses have been proven *on average* to be as effective as these “standard” doses. Conjugated estrogens in a dose of 0.3 or 0.45 mg effectively produce a gain in BMD when combined with 1.5 mg MPA; similarly, a dose of 0.5-mg micronized estradiol produces comparable effects.118-121 The 0.45/1.5-mg and 0.3/1.5-mg conjugated estrogens/MPA combinations effectively reduce VMS as well as improve symptoms related to vaginal atrophy and measures of sexual function in a pattern that is quantitatively and qualitatively similar to the 0.625/2.5-mg combination, and with lesser mastalgia.122,123 These lower dose combinations are also associated with less breakthrough bleeding and higher rates of cumulative amenorrhea compared with older standard-dose regimens and retain the favorable changes in the lipid profile.124,125 At these lower doses of conjugated estrogens, the combination with progestin produces an additive benefit; therefore, when these lower doses of estrogen are used without progestin, the effect on mitigation of VMS may not be as great as seen with the combination regimen. In a dose-response study, the most efficacious dose of oral micronized estradiol was 1 mg/d.126 The lower dose combination of EE and NETA (2.5 μg/0.5 mg) is nearly as effective in treating hot flushes as the higher dose combination (5.0 μg/1.0 mg).127 **Vigilance is advised in assessing response with lower dose regimens; innate differences in rate of metabolism and clearance may account for some women not attaining effective symptom control with the use of low-dose formulations.**

**Menopausal Hormone Therapy: Progestational Component**

Many women do not tolerate treatment with progestational hormones. Typical side effects include breast tenderness, bloating, and depression. These reactions are significant detrimental factors with continuance. Breast discomfort associated with postmenopausal HT can be attributed largely to progestins. Comparison studies have not been performed to address whether this symptom is minimized by particular progestins. Can a progestational agent be administered less frequently? We are secure in our position, supported by clinical data, that a daily estrogen plus progestin combination regimen will effectively prevent endometrial hyperplasia. A sequential regimen that incorporates progestin exposure for less than 14 days has over time an increased risk of endometrial hyperplasia.128,129 Sequential regimens with less than 14 days of progestin monthly or *even long-term use of recommended schedules* do not match the protection offered by the daily, continuous method of estrogen-progestin treatment.

Two metabolites of progesterone, allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, are believed to be responsible for progesterone’s unique sedative effect. Treatment regimens with micronized progesterone should be taken at bedtime, and these estrogen-progesterone combinations are a good choice for women with sleep difficulties. A study in a sleep laboratory has demonstrated a significant improvement in sleep quantity and quality in women using a sequential regimen of estrogen and micronized progesterone in contrast to no effect in the group using MPA.130

Some patients are very sensitive to MPA. One can consider a trial of norethindrone instead. In a sequential regimen, the dose of norethindrone is

0.7 mg (available in the progestin-only oral contraceptive; each pill contains 0.35 mg norethindrone). In the continuous, combined regimen, the dose of norethindrone is 0.35 mg daily. Commercial combination products are available containing estradiol and NETA. DRSP is the newest generation progestin that is available as a progestin-only contraceptive as well as in combination with 17β estradiol as a combined hormone formulation (Angeliq, containing 2-mg DRSP and 1-mg 17β-estradiol).131

Progesterone can also be administered vaginally. A vaginal gel allows the delivery of very low doses that can effectively protect the endometrium with low systemic levels because of a first-pass effect on the uterus.132 The administration of 90 mg every 2 days produces secretory changes in the endometrium.133 An application of the 4% commercial preparation (Crinone) twice weekly protects the endometrium and is associated with amenorrhea in most patients. In a sequential regimen, the 4% preparation should be applied daily for at least 14 days each month; however, long-term data on endometrial safety are lacking.134 The application of a 100-mg vaginal tablet (Endometrin) every other day is also effective, with long-term follow-up of 3 years demonstrating no endometrial hyperplasia.135 More recently, results of a subanalysis of the Early versus Late Intervention Trial with Estradiol (ELITE) have raised concerns regarding the effectiveness of cyclic regimen of vaginal progesterone in adequately negating endometrial effects of estrogen in menopausal women on cyclic HT; over an observation period of 80 months, those randomized to daily oral micronized 17β-E2 1 mg/d with 4% vaginal micronized progesterone gel 45 mg/d for 10 days each month were noted to have significantly increased endometrial thickness, higher rate of endometrial biopsies, and higher incidence of endometrial hyperplasia compared to those assigned to placebo.136 Therefore, vigilance is advised if choosing a vaginal route for progesterone administration in conjunction with systemic estrogen for long-term use; in such cases, periodic endometrial surveillance utilizing ultrasound assessments and endometrial biopsy as indicated would serve well.

The transdermal estrogen-progestin combinations incorporate NETA in a daily dose of 0.140 or 0.250 mg; or levonorgestrel (LNG) in daily doses

of 0.007, 0.015, 0.030, and 0.040 mg/d; and, in a sequential regimen, NETA, 0.250 mg, or LNG, 0.010 mg.137-139

***Infrequent Progestational Exposure: Long Sequential Regimens***

Such regimens are increasingly being considered, either for the convenience of lesser frequency of withdrawal bleeding episodes associated with cyclic progesterone use or for those wishing to minimize progestin exposure duration. Experience with extended-cycle regimens, however, is very limited. The administration of MPA every 3 months was associated in one study with longer, heavier menses and unscheduled bleeding and a 1.5% incidence of hyperplasia at 1 year, whereas in another study, overall bleeding was less, but the incidence of hyperplasia was approximately 4%.140,141 In a Dutch study that was only 12 weeks in length, simple endometrial hyperplasia was encountered at the end of the unopposed estrogen phase.142,143 In yet another study, there was no endometrial hyperplasia encountered by 143 women who completed 2 years of treatment; however, the progestin administered every 3 months was of high dosage, 20 mg MPA daily for 14 days.144 In Finland, the addition of progestin at 3-month intervals was associated with a striking increase in the risk of endometrial cancer when this regimen was used for many years.145 Most impressively, the Scandinavian Long Cycle Study, a clinical trial scheduled to last 5 years, was canceled after 3 years because of a 12.5% incidence of endometrial pathology and one case of endometrial cancer.117,146 Given the lack of long-term data on safety of extended regimens, if a patient chooses such an approach, endometrial monitoring is advised. **Any program that differs from the standard regimen should consider periodic surveillance of the endometrium** (**as discussed earlier in this chapter**)**. Even the long-term use of standard sequential regimens is subject to a small increase in the risk for endometrial cancer, and endometrial surveillance should be considered in women using this method.**

**We caution against long regimens in women who may be at an innately higher risk for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer, such as those with a personal history of endometrial hyperplasia, those who are obese, those who are insulin-resistant, and women who are diabetic.**

***The Progestin Intrauterine Device***

The LNG-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs) are increasingly being used in estrogen-taking postmenopausal women to confer endometrial protection.147-151 The intrauterine presence of the progestin effectively protects the endometrium against hyperplasia and cancer.152 The local site of action provides endometrial protection while minimizing systemic progestin side effects; for example, estrogen’s favorable lipid effects are not attenuated with intrauterine progestin.153 As with the oral continuous, combined regimens, irregular breakthrough bleeding may occur in the first 6 months, and after 1 year, approximately 60% to 70% of the women are amenorrheic. The LNG system has the advantage of a 5- to 7-year duration of use. These methods provide treatment options that minimize substantially the systemic effects of progestins.

***Special Considerations for Progestin Use***

Inclusion of a progestational agent in menopausal HT regimen is exclusively for endometrial benefit. Thus, the use of estrogen-alone hormone formulations reflects the standard of clinical care in managing menopausal symptoms in women without a uterus. However, there are some special conditions that warrant consideration of a combined estrogen-progestin regimen even in hysterectomized women.

### **ROLE OF ANDROGENS IN MENOPAUSE MANAGEMENT**

The total amount of testosterone produced after menopause is decreased because the amount of the primary source, peripheral conversion of androstenedione, is reduced. The early postmenopausal circulating level of androstenedione decreases approximately 62% from young adult life.161 Nevertheless, the menopausal decline in the circulating levels of testosterone is not great, from no change in many women to as much as 15% in others.156,161-163 In an excellent longitudinal Australian study from 5 years before menopause to 7 years after menopause, the circulating levels of testosterone did not change.164 Indeed, because of a decrease in SHBG, this Australian study calculated an increase in free androgens. The total amount of testosterone produced per day, however, is slightly decreased because the primary source, the peripheral conversion of androstenedione, is reduced. Because of this decrease, some argue for inclusion of an androgen in menopausal HT regimen.

The potential benefits of androgen treatment include improvement in psychological well-being and an increase in sexually motivated behavior. **Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is defined as a decrease in sexual activity sufficient to cause distress.** Beneficial effects of androgen treatment have been reported with the administration of relatively large doses of androgen.165 In a well-designed, placebo-controlled study, lower doses of androgen (but still very pharmacologic, 5 mg methyltestosterone) contributed little to actual sexual behavior, although an increase in sexual fantasies and masturbation could be documented.166 Transdermal testosterone treatment of women improved sexual function compared with a placebo group but only in the dose that raised circulating testosterone levels

to about 100 ng/dL. (The upper limit of normal for reproductive-aged women is 80 ng/dL in most laboratories.)167 In a recent systematic review on the topic, while concluding that existing data support that testosterone therapy alleviates many of the signs and symptoms related to sexual dysfunction in menopausal women, the authors underscored a need for additional studies, given that existing evidence is limited due to the small sample sizes and the relatively few studies on the topic.

Any benefit must be balanced by the unwanted effects, in particular virilization (acne, alopecia, and hirsutism) and a negative impact on the cholesterol-lipoprotein profile. In a short-term study comparing a product with estrogen and a relatively low oral dose of testosterone (1.25-mg methyltestosterone) to estrogen alone, a negative impact on the lipid profile was apparent within 3 months of initiating treatment.168 Over a 2-year period, the administration of estrogen (1.25 mg) combined with 2.5-mg methyltestosterone produced a significant overall adverse impact on the cholesterol-lipoprotein profile.169 In addition, 30% of the patients experienced acne, and 36% developed facial hirsutism. A lower dose of this combination (0.625-mg esterified estrogens and 1.25-mg methyltestosterone) also significantly lowered HDL cholesterol.170 The adverse impact on the lipid profile is less (and may even be avoided) by the parenteral administration of testosterone.171 Of course, the clinical effects of these metabolic changes are not known.

**It should be remembered that androgens do not protect the endometrium from unopposed effects of estrogen, and the addition of a progestin is still necessary.** It is uncertain (and unstudied) how much aromatization, especially local aromatization in target tissues, of the administered testosterone increases the estrogen impact and whether this might increase the risk of endometrial and/or breast cancer. The addition of androgen to standard HT regimen does not reduce the amount of breakthrough bleeding women experience with a continuous combination (estrogen \+ progestin) regimen.169,172 Adding testosterone to an ET program has been reported to provide no additional beneficial impact on the bone or on relief from hot flushes.169,173 On the other hand, others have demonstrated a greater increase in bone density with an estrogen-androgen combination compared with estrogen alone, although the blood levels achieved were higher than those associated with standard menopausal HT.171 In another

study, only a very pharmacologic dose of methyltestosterone added to the bone density achieved with estrogen alone.174 A greater effect on bone associated with androgen treatment may be indirect, reflecting higher free estrogen levels because of a reduction in SHBG and/or androgen-induced changes in muscle mass.

There is no doubt that pharmacologic amounts of androgen can increase libido, but these same doses result in supraphysiologic levels and produce unwanted effects.175 In addition, patients on high doses of androgens are often somewhat addicted to this therapy. Small amounts of androgen supplementation can be provided in situations in which the patient and clinician are convinced that a depressed libido cannot be explained by psychosocial circumstances. In these cases, the lipid profile should be carefully monitored. Any positive clinical response may well be a placebo effect. The products that are available in various parts of the world include oral testosterone undecanoate, sublingual micronized testosterone, intramuscular injections, subcutaneous implants, and transdermal preparations (eg, Intrinsa, applied twice a week).176 Unfortunately, there is currently no testosterone formulation that is approved by the FDA for use in women; in clinical practice, the testosterone transdermal gel marketed for use in men (AndroGel), 5 g/d, can be used at a starting dose of about 1 g/d. Testosterone undecanoate produces very high testosterone levels with great variability and is not recommended.177 **If testosterone use is considered, our preferred method is to use a product that will allow dose to be titrated by measuring the total testosterone blood level with the goal of maintaining concentration in the range of 20 to 80 ng/dL.**

The initial clinical trials concluding that the 300-μg transdermal dose of testosterone was effective for low libido consisted of women with either surgical (1,172 women) or natural menopause (549 women) who were also being treated with estrogen.178,179 A 1-year, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of 814 women with hypoactive sexual desire disorder and not on ET from 65 centers in the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and Sweden assessed the impact of transdermal testosterone that delivered 150 or 300 μg/d.180 The higher dose of testosterone increased sexuality (including desire, arousal, orgasm, and pleasure) by 1.4 episodes per month compared with placebo. This increase appeared as early as the second month of treatment. The lower dose did not differ from placebo. In

the higher dose group, 30% reported unwanted androgenic effects (essentially an increase in facial hair). In addition, one woman in the low-dose group and three women in the high-dose group developed clitoral enlargement (the enlargement resolved in the woman receiving the low dose, but not in the high-dose women). The frequency of acne, alopecia, and voice deepening was the same in all groups. It is certainly plausible that with longer exposure to the high dose, more women would develop androgenic side effects. There were four cases of breast cancer in the treatment groups and none in the placebo group; however, one was diagnosed after only 4 months of treatment and one had a bloody nipple discharge before the trial started, making it difficult to determine if these were preexisting or de novo cancers.

In the Nurses’ Health Study, the risk of invasive breast cancer associated with the use of combined estrogen and testosterone was nearly 2-fold increased.181 This report from the Nurses’ Health Study is complicated by the same problem in other breast cancer reports from this cohort: The hormone users (in this case, estrogen and testosterone) differ substantially from never users. This requires multiple statistical adjustments, a process that is further influenced by the number of cases involved. The analysis is limited by relatively small numbers; there were only 29 cases of breast cancer among the estrogen-testosterone users. Nevertheless, the results should raise caution regarding the postmenopausal use of androgens.

If testosterone affects breast tissue, does it do so directly or is it aromatized locally into estrogen? Most studies indicate that testosterone inhibits proliferation of breast cancer cell lines in vitro, as well as in vivo markers of breast epithelial proliferation in animals and women,182,183 suggesting that aromatization is of greater concern. Testosterone preparations such as implants and transdermal applications do carry the risk of target tissue aromatization, perhaps raising *local* estrogen levels to high levels in breast tissue. Perhaps, an argument against this possibility was the failure to demonstrate any increase in breast density associated with transdermal testosterone treatment, even with the higher dose.184 However, the mean age of the women in this study was 54.6, and an increase in breast density with estrogen-progestin therapy is largely observed in women over age 55; in younger women, it is difficult to find any differences between hormone users and nonusers.185

In the transdermal testosterone trial with women *not* on estrogen treatment, there was a 10.6% incidence of vaginal bleeding in the women who had not undergone hysterectomy and were receiving the higher dose, compared with 2.6% in the placebo group and 2.7% in the low-dose group.180 Was this due to aromatization of testosterone in the endometrium? There were no cases of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in this trial, but again, a longer duration of exposure might have unwanted consequences. This issue cannot be resolved without long-term data. In addition, the long-term effects on the cardiovascular system are unknown.

Response in the clinical trials with transdermal testosterone did not correlate with testosterone levels at baseline, and higher levels during treatment did not predict androgenic side effects. This is not surprising because measurement of free and bioavailable testosterone is subject to considerable inaccuracy and variability. For this reason, testosterone levels cannot be used to diagnose the hypoactive sexual desire disorder.186 The transdermal clinical trials have reported that all testosterone levels remained within the premenopausal ranges. However, the mean level of free testosterone was relatively high at 6.8 pg/mL, although within the reference range. According to the data in the supplemental appendix, available only online, the mean levels were at or above the upper end of the reference age. In addition, because of individual variability, there was a wide range of testosterone levels, with a significant number of values elevated above normal. For many women, these are not physiologic levels. We do not know if it is possible to avoid unwanted consequences by careful monitoring of blood levels.

Currently, there is no testosterone formulation that is approved for exclusive use in the female population in the United States.187 In contrast, the Australia’s Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approved Androfeme exclusively for women in 2019, and this drug is licensed nationwide in Australia.188 Estratest, a combination of esterified estrogen with methyltestosterone—at higher (2.5-mg methyltestosterone) and lower (1.5 mg methyltestosterone) dose combination formulation was previously available in the United States for off-label use189; the product was, however, discontinued in March 2009\. Compounded testosterone formulations in the form of gels, pellets, and injectable testosterone (decanoate, enanthate, cypionate) have been variably utilized but are not FDA-approved. With

gels, 5 mg (1%) is recommended.190 Various doses have been used for injectable testosterone, with currently no adverse effects noted; however, outcomes have only been measured over a 6-month period.191 Exercising extreme caution when considering testosterone pellet therapy is warranted, given concern for supraphysiologic doses achieved. Furthermore, in women with breast cancer, uterine cancer, CVD, or liver disease, testosterone use is generally contraindicated.189

There is little doubt that the pharmacologic amounts of testosterone can produce favorable effects on sexuality, but it remains doubtful that this beneficial impact can be seen while maintaining testosterone levels within the normal physiologic range. Some women receiving pharmacologic amounts of testosterone develop very high circulating levels. The fundamental problem is that the long-term consequences of pharmacologic amounts of testosterone are unknown. **If a clinician and a patient choose to use supplemental androgens, our advice is to select a treatment that can be monitored with measurements of total testosterone in serum.** The choices include the testosterone transdermal patch, a testosterone skin gel (on the market for use in men), and testosterone compounded for individual use by a pharmacist. We are left with this question: Is a modest increase in one or two episodes per month sufficient to offset the unanswered question of long-term safety? Some women would say yes, but the clinician has an obligation to avoid excessive doses and to educate the patient regarding the unanswered questions. **Prior to initiation, we recommend obtaining baseline lipid, and liver function tests and periodic surveillance** (**3 months following initiation and yearly thereafter**) **are recommended to ensure safety.** The free testosterone index can be used to monitor testosterone levels (goal of physiologic levels) with all testosterone formulations. Of note, oral methyltestosterone cannot be measured, as it is not detected in existing testosterone assays.189 As long-term safety data are limited, it is highly recommended that a discussion for treatment discontinuation be made with patients at 6 months following initiation.189,192

**While a role of testosterone therapy in women’s health remains somewhat controversial, in the setting of reduced libido, testosterone may be beneficial for some menopausal women not responding to traditional HT.**

**Dehydroepiandrosterone**

Adrenal androgen production decreases dramatically with aging. The mechanism is not known, but it is not due to the loss of estrogen at menopause nor can it be reversed with estrogen treatment.193 The impressive decline (75-85%) in circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) that occurs with aging (greater in men than in women) has stimulated a search for a beneficial impact of DHEA supplementation.194

The only proven function of DHEA and its sulfate, DHEA-S, is to provide a pool of prohormone for conversion to androgens and ultimately estrogens. By age 70 or 80, the circulating levels in men and women are about 10% of peak levels that occur between 20 and 30 years of age. Systemic DHEA supplementation does not produce improvements in menopausal symptoms, mood, libido, cognition, or memory, but it does increase testosterone and decrease HDL cholesterol.195 The acute administration of DHEA did produce a modest effect on sexual response in postmenopausal women, but the dose was enormous, 300 mg.196

Although low levels of DHEA and DHEA-S have been reported to be associated with increased risk of CVD in men, in women, conflicting results are found in cross-sectional data. In a longitudinal study of 236 women, higher levels of DHEA and DHEA-S in middle-aged women correlated with an *increased* risk of CVD.197

DHEA supplementation, 50 mg/d, produced levels of DHEA-S in reproductive age range in older men, did not change levels of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone, and raised estradiol and estrone levels, although still within normal range.198 However, in women, 25 or 50 mg/d increased testosterone levels, decreased SHBG levels, and produced adverse effects on the lipid profile.199,200 Exogenously administered DHEA is converted to potent androgens and estrogens. Potential long-term effects include hirsutism, alopecia, voice changes, breast effects, and an increased risk of CHD. Supplementation with DHEA requires dose titration using the circulating level of total testosterone and keeping the concentration below 80 ng/dL. This can be difficult because of the variability in DHEA content of the many commercial products available in the market; the FDA

measured DHEA content of 45 commercial products, and assayed values varied widely from 0% to 109.5%\!201

In contrast to systemic DHEA formulations, a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of daily intravaginal use of DHEA (trade name *Prasterone*) in a dose of 0.5% (6.5 mg) demonstrated significantly improved symptoms of vaginal atrophy, with little change in the serum levels of DHEA, estradiol, and testosterone.202-206 Presumably, the vaginally administered DHEA is converted locally to estrogen and testosterone within the vaginal tissue, a phenomenon that is recognized as “intracrinology.”207 In clinical trials comparing DHEA to 0.3-mg CEE or 10-μg E2 daily, DHEA was found to be at least as effective as CEE and/or estradiol in improving vulvovaginal symptoms.208 There was no effect of vaginal DHEA on the endometrium or liver; however, impact on bone is unknown.

### **SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS**

A greater understanding of the ER mechanism (see Chapter 1\) allows us to understand how mixed estrogen agonists/antagonists can have selective actions on specific target tissues. New agents are continuously being developed in efforts to isolate the desired actions (improvement in VMS and bone density) from unwanted side effects (proliferative effects on endometrial and breast tissue). Indeed, in time, we can expect to see new products with progressively better agonist/antagonist profiles, yielding increasingly user-friendly drugs.

**Raloxifene**

Therapeutic benefit of raloxifene is well established for the skeleton and breast tissue, and its role in menopause management is primarily for targeted benefits toward fracture and breast cancer risk reduction. Briefly, raloxifene exerts estrogenic effects on the skeleton (further discussed in Chapter 23\) without having any proliferative effects on the endometrium. A major limitation of raloxifene and similar selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) is the lack of efficacy against VMS; if anything, women taking raloxifene may even experience a worsening of hot flushes\!
