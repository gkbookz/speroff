For the smaller subset of hormone-using menopausal women who are bothered by persistent unscheduled bleeding that remains unresponsive to earlier-mentioned strategies, consideration for definitive surgery (such as vaginal hysterectomy) may not be unreasonable.

### **HEALTH IMPLICATIONS OF MENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY**

**Cardiovascular Effects552**

***A Favorable Impact on Lipids and Lipoproteins***

The most important lipid effects of postmenopausal estrogen treatment are the reduction in LDL cholesterol and the increase in HDL cholesterol. Estrogen increases triglyceride levels and LDL cholesterol catabolism as well as lipoprotein receptor numbers and activity, resulting in decreasing LDL cholesterol levels.553-555 Estrogen induces a change in LDL cholesterol toward a smaller more dense particle, but it is in a form with a more rapid turnover in the circulation, allowing less time for oxidation and acquisition of cholesterol.556,557 The increase in HDL cholesterol levels, particularly due to the HDL2 subfraction, is to an important degree the consequence of the

inhibition of hepatic lipase activity, which converts HDL2 to HDL3 (**Figure 22.5**). Postmenopausal ET with or without added progestin also produces a reduction in the circulating levels of lipoprotein(a).558,559

**FIGURE 22.5**

The changes in circulating apoprotein levels mirror those of the lipoproteins: Apolipoprotein B (the principal surface protein of LDL cholesterol) levels diminish in response to estrogen, and apolipoprotein A-I (the principal apolipoprotein of HDL cholesterol) increases. The positive effects of estrogens on cholesterol may be mitigated by the concomitant use of progestins.111,113,560-565 In an interesting approach to understanding the differential in cardiovascular risks noted in the two WHI hormone trials (CEE+MPA and CEE alone), ametabolomic analysis was undertaken at baseline and 1-year samples in 503 and 431 participants in the WHI CEE and CEE+MPA trial, and relevance of differentially altered metabolites by type of HT (CEE alone vs CEE+MPA) was evaluated for an association with incident CHD in 944 participants (472 CHD cases) of the WHI-OS; these associations were further confirmed in an independent replication cohort of 980 participants (men and women) in the PREDIMED trial (Prevenci6n con Dieta Mediterranea) deemed at high risk for CHD. A differential effect of HT regimen on the metabolome was apparent. Twelve metabolites had discordant effects by HT and were associated with incident CHD in the WHI-OS. All 12 metabolites were altered in the CHD protective direction by CEE exposure, whereas a single metabolite (lysine) was significantly altered in the direction of increased CHD risk by CEE+MPA exposure. Associations of a subset of four metabolites (C58:11 triacylglycerol, C54:9 triacylglycerol, C36:1 phosphatidylcholine, and sucrose) were replicated in the PREDIMED population.566

The concomitant administration of estrogen and an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (such as pravastatin) produced a more favorable change in the lipid profile in women with hypercholesterolemia than either treatment alone.567

***Direct Antiatherosclerotic Effects***

Studies in nonhuman primates (such as monkeys) have suggested that estrogen may have antiatherosclerotic effects that are independent of the cholesterol-lipoprotein profile. Oral administration of a combination of estrogen and a high dose of progestin to monkeys fed a high-cholesterol diet decreased the extent of coronary atherosclerosis despite a reduction in HDL cholesterol levels.568-570 In somewhat similar experiments, estrogen treatment markedly prevented arterial lesion development in rabbits, and

this effect was not reduced by adding progestin to the treatment regimen.571-

574

The monkey studies were extended to a postmenopausal model (ovariectomized monkeys). Compared with no hormone treatment, treatment with either estrogen alone or estrogen with progesterone in a sequential manner significantly reduced atherosclerosis, once again independently of the circulating lipid and lipoprotein profile.575,576 A direct inhibition of LDL cholesterol accumulation and an increase in LDL cholesterol metabolism in arterial vessels could be demonstrated in these monkeys being fed a highly atherogenic diet.577 The daily administration of MPA in this monkey model did not prevent the beneficial effect of CEE on coronary artery atherosclerosis.442

Estradiol fatty acid esters are present in low concentrations in the circulation, transported in lipoproteins. These esters are potent estrogens and protect against the oxidation of LDL cholesterol; the antioxidant efficacy of estradiol may require esterification and incorporation into LDL cholesterol.578 Estradiol fatty acid ester concentrations are increased by oral estrogen, but not by transdermal administration.579

***Endothelium-Dependent Vasodilation and Antiplatelet Aggregation (see Figure 22.6)***

Endothelium modulates the degree of contraction and function of the surrounding smooth muscle, primarily by the release of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting factors. In hypertension and other CVDs, the release of relaxing factors (such as nitric oxide) is blunted, and the release of contracting factors (the most important being endothelin-1) is augmented. The endothelins are a family of peptides that act in a paracrine manner on smooth muscle cells. Endothelin-1 appears to be exclusively synthesized by endothelial cells. Endothelin-induced vasoconstriction is a consequence of a direct action on vascular smooth muscle cells, an action that is reversed by nitric oxide. Impaired release of nitric oxide, therefore, enhances endothelin action. Hypertension and atherosclerosis are believed to be influenced by the balance among these factors. Women have lower circulating levels of endothelin, which decrease in response to oral and transdermal estrogen treatment.580,581  
![][image11]

**FIGURE 22.6**

Nitric oxide (and estrogen) also inhibits the adhesion and aggregation of platelets in a synergistic manner with prostacyclin (also a potent vasodilator derived from the endothelium).582,583 Increased blood flow due to vasodilation and decreased peripheral resistance can be observed to occur rapidly following the administration of estrogen. This response can be produced by both transdermal and oral administration.584-586 The synthesis and secretion of nitric oxide (the potent endothelial vasodilating product) can be directly stimulated by estrogen in in vitro experimental preparations of coronary arteries.587 In both normotensive postmenopausal women and women with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, or coronary artery disease, the intra-arterial infusion of physiologic amounts of estradiol into the forearm potentiates endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and there is a dose-response effect.588,589 Similarly, brachial artery dilation has been reported with 0.3 and 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens.590 Comparing brachial artery responses in HT users versus nonusers (estrogens with/without progestin), improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation was observed with standard doses.591 Furthermore, the addition of NETA or MPA did not reduce the beneficial effect of estrogen on peripheral artery blood flow.592,593 However, not all studies agree. A Danish assessment of brachial artery responses demonstrated no difference between

postmenopausal women on long-term combined estrogen-progestin therapy compared with those receiving no treatment.594

The synthesis of nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of vascular (and gastrointestinal) tone and neuronal activity. A family of isozymes (nitric oxide synthases) catalyzes the oxidation of L\-arginine to nitric oxide and citrulline. The action of nitric oxide synthase in the endothelium is calcium dependent.595 In animal experiments, the endothelial basal release of nitric oxide is greater in females, a gender difference that is mediated by estrogen.587,596 In women treated with postmenopausal estrogen and either cyproterone acetate or MPA, circulating nitric oxide (as reflected in nitrite-nitrate levels) is increased, a consequence of estrogen-induced nitric oxide production in the endothelium.597,598 In contrast, long-term treatment with estradiol and NETA was not associated with changes in nitric oxide, endothelin-1, prostacyclin, or thromboxane A2, suggesting that different

progestins have differential effects.599

Acetylcholine induces vasoconstriction in coronary arteries; however, the direct administration of estradiol in physiologic doses into the coronary arteries of postmenopausal women with and without CHD converts acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction into vasodilation with increased flow.600 This favorable vasomotor response to acetylcholine can also be demonstrated in acute experiments with transdermal administration of estradiol (achieving blood levels of 67-89 pg/mL).601 This is an endothelium-dependent response, mediated to a significant degree by an increase in nitric oxide.602 In the monkey, the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine required a blood level of estradiol higher than 60 pg/mL.603

***Endothelium-Independent Vasodilation***

Estrogen causes relaxation in coronary arteries that are denuded of endothelium.604 This response is not prevented by the presence of inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase or prostaglandin synthase, thus suggesting that some degree of vasodilation in response to estrogen is achieved through a mechanism that is independent of the vascular endothelium, perhaps acting via calcium-mediated events.605 The vasodilation produced by sodium nitroprusside is endothelium-independent. In otherwise healthy postmenopausal women and in those with risk factors for atherosclerosis

(hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease), administration of physiologic doses of estradiol increased forearm vasodilation induced by sodium nitroprusside.588 However, others have reported no effect of estrogen administration on endothelium-independent vasodilation.586

***Actions on the Heart and Large Blood Vessels***

Estrogen treatment in some studies was associated with increased left ventricular diastolic filling and stroke volume,586,606-608 an effect that probably reflects a direct inotropic action of estrogen.609 In a 3-month study, MPA (5 mg daily for 10 days each month) did not attenuate the increase in left ventricular output (systolic flow velocity) observed with estrogen treatment.610 On the other hand, others have detected attenuation of estrogen’s beneficial effects on compliance (stiffness) associated with combined estrogen-progestin treatment.609,611 And others have not been able to demonstrate an effect of short-term oral estrogen or long-term transdermal estrogen treatment on cardiac structure and function.612,613 The reasons for these observations as well as the differences remain unclear.

***Actions on Glucose Metabolism***

An age-related decline in the basal metabolic rate is accentuated at menopause, associated with an increase in body fat, especially central (android) body fat.614,615 Insulin resistance and circulating insulin levels increase in women after menopause, and impaired glucose tolerance predicts an increased risk of CHD.616,617 Estrogen (with or without progestin) prevents the tendency to increase central body fat with aging.618-621 The WHI randomized clinical trial documented improvements in fasting glucose and insulin levels in the estrogen/progestin-treated group.622 Hyperinsulinemia also has a direct atherogenic effect on blood vessels, perhaps secondary to insulin propeptides. In addition to its vasoconstrictive properties, endothelin-1 exerts a mitogenic effect and, therefore, contributes to the atherosclerotic process. Insulin directly stimulates the secretion of endothelin-1 in endothelial cells, and the circulating levels of endothelin-1 are correlated with insulin levels.623

Postmenopausal women being treated with oral estrogen have lower fasting insulin levels and a lesser insulin response to glucose.562,622-627 In a 1-

year randomized trial comparing unopposed conjugated estrogens to the usual sequential and continuous regimens of conjugated estrogens and MPA, no differences in the treatment groups were observed in the favorable decreases in fasting insulin levels.562 Nonoral administration of estrogen has little effect on insulin metabolism, unless a dose is administered that is equivalent to 1.25 mg conjugated estrogens.625,628 Because a lower oral dose produces a beneficial impact, this suggests that the hepatic first-pass effect is important in this response, at least in normal women; reports with transdermal HT have indicated improvements in insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia, but no effect in women with normal insulin sensitivity.629,630 In double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled studies of postmenopausal women with type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, estrogen treatment improved all glucose metabolic parameters (including insulin resistance), the lipoprotein profile, and measurements of androgenicity.631,632

**The evidence strongly indicates that postmenopausal ET improves glucose metabolism. Epidemiologic studies impressively document that this beneficial metabolic effect associated with estrogen lowers the incidence of adult-onset, type 2 diabetes mellitus.** Three large cohort studies, the Nurses’ Health Study, the Finnish Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention Study, and the French E3N study, reported decreases in new-onset diabetes associated with ET.633-635 In the French cohort, no effect of progestins was observed, and the reduction in the incidence of diabetes (32%) was greater with oral administration of estrogen compared with the transdermal method.635 Clinical trial results are in agreement. In the Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) trial, the hormone-treated group developed diabetes at a rate that was 35% lower compared with the placebo group.627 Similar findings were observed in the WHI hormone trials wherein a 21% reduction in incident diabetes was observed in the combined CEE and MPA trial, whereas a 12% reduction with the estrogen-alone trial.68,636

***Inhibition of Lipoprotein Oxidation***

The oxidation of LDL cholesterol particles is a step (perhaps the initial step) in the formation of atherosclerosis, and smoking is associated with a high  level  of  lipoprotein  oxidation.  In  animal  experiments,  the

administration of large amounts of antioxidants inhibits the formation of atherosclerosis and causes the regression of existing lesions. Estrogen is an antioxidant. Estradiol directly inhibits LDL cholesterol oxidation in response to copper and decreases the overall formation of lipid oxides.637,638 Importantly, this antioxidant action of estradiol is associated with physiologic blood levels.639 In addition, estrogen may regenerate circulating antioxidants (tocopherols and β-carotene) and preserve these antioxidants within LDL cholesterol particles. This antioxidant action of estrogen preserves endothelial-dependent vasodilator function by preventing the deleterious effect that oxidized LDL cholesterol has on endothelial production of vasoactive agents.640 In an assessment of peroxide formation by platelets, women treated with both estrogen and MPA in a sequential regimen had greater antioxidant activity compared with the days on estrogen alone.641 In a 1-year study, the presence of LNG did not attenuate the antioxidant activity of estradiol.642

***A Favorable Impact on Fibrinolysis***

Menopause is followed by increases in factor VII, fibrinogen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1).643,644 These changes produce a relatively hypercoagulable state and are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Postmenopausal women treated with estrogen have lower fibrinogen and plasminogen levels. Reduced levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and PAI-1 have been observed in premenopausal women compared with postmenopausal women, and oral estrogen alone or combined with a progestin prevents the usual increase in these clotting factors associated with menopause.645-649 This would be consistent with increased fibrinolytic activity, a possible cardioprotective mechanism probably mediated, at least partially, by nitric oxide and prostacyclin. Platelet aggregation is also reduced by postmenopausal estrogen treatment, and this response is slightly attenuated by MPA.582 In a randomized 1-year trial, the addition of MPA, either sequentially or continuously, produced a more favorable change in coagulation factors compared with unopposed estrogen.650

The transdermal and oral routes of administration of estrogen (combined with MPA) have puzzling differences in the reported effects on most hemostatic risk factors, such as factor VII, fibrinogen, PAI-1, and

antithrombin III. In at least one study, antithrombin III levels were reduced by oral estrogen, but not by transdermal administration; however, the values remained within the normal range.651 In regard to PAI-1, studies with transdermal estrogen have provided conflicting data, varying from favorable changes in PAI-1 levels to no effect.35,652,653 However, in a crossover study designed to compare 100 μg transdermal estradiol with 0.625 mg oral conjugated estrogens (both combined with 2.5 mg MPA daily), only the oral estrogen had a favorable reduction in PAI-1 levels.653 Appropriate doses of HT have been reported to not have an adverse impact on clotting factors646,654,655; however, the clotting story is difficult to unravel. While no RCTs have analyzed the difference in VTE risk between oral and transdermal estrogen, observational studies have demonstrated a difference in risk based on routes of administration. A recent meta-analysis showed that oral estrogen administration resulted in an increased risk of VTE, which was not seen with transdermal estrogen administration.656,657 In addition, oral estrogen use in conjunction with progesterone has been associated with a greater risk of VTE than oral estrogen use alone.658 Several factors, which are not controlled for in observational trials, also make it difficult to draw a conclusion from the aforementioned data. The frequency (cyclic vs continuous) and derivative of progesterone used were not controlled for in observational trials. Inherent differences in estrogen’s route of administration also likely affected the observed results—estrogens’ effects on hepatic first-pass metabolism (namely, oral estrogen’s ability to alter the synthesis and clearance of hemostatic proteins), oral estrogens’ ability to activate the coagulation cascade, and estrogens’ effects on thrombin generation. Thus, a randomized controlled study comparing the effects of oral versus transdermal estrogen, with or without the addition of progesterone derivative, is needed before a definitive statement regarding the superiority of one form of administration or another can be made.

How can there be favorable changes indicating an increase in fibrinolysis and at the same time an increased risk of venous thrombosis, and why in older women, especially those with clinically apparent CHD, does estrogen seem to have a prothrombotic effect? Decreases in antithrombin III and protein S associated with estrogen treatment, a hypercoagulable change, may have a greater impact on the venous system.659 There may also be subtle variations of inherited susceptibilities

that tilt the balance toward thrombosis; for example, concentrations of factors that favor arterial thrombosis have been reported (tissue factor pathway coagulation inhibitor and thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor) in women treated with estrogens.660 Another possibility is that the fibrinolysis is a response to coagulation activity and, therefore, not necessarily a beneficial response.

Estrogen has adverse effects on already-established atherosclerosis. MMP enzymes are secreted by inflammatory cells and smooth muscle cells. These enzymes digest the proteins in the fibrous cap of an atherosclerotic plaque, making the plaque unstable and predisposed to rupture. Estrogen induces MMP enzymes and decreases their specific inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase or TIMP); this is a mechanism involved in the prothrombotic effects of estrogen in the presence of established atherosclerosis. This effect of estrogen may be dose-related and might be avoided with transdermal administration.661

***Inhibition of Intimal Thickening***

Hypertension and atherosclerosis are associated with increased proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. This growth of smooth muscle cells is also characterized by migration into the intima. Arterial intimal thickening is an early indicator of atherosclerosis. The proliferation and migration of human aortic smooth muscle cells in response to growth factors are inhibited by estradiol, and, importantly, this inhibition is not prevented by the presence of progestins.662,663 Nitric oxide, which is regulated by estrogen, also inhibits smooth muscle proliferation and migration.664 Imaging studies have documented a reduction in intimal thickening in postmenopausal women who are estrogen users compared with nonusers, and this beneficial effect is not compromised by the addition of a progestational agent to the treatment regimen.611,665-667 Thus, postmenopausal HT can bring about a reduction in atherosclerosis, and this effect is comparable with that produced by a lipid-lowering drug.665,668

***Protection of Endothelial Cells***

Endothelial cells can respond to injury by initiating the clotting process. Animal studies indicate that estrogen accelerates healing and recovery of the endothelium in response to injury.669 This is correlated with inhibition of

intimal thickening and recovery of important functions, such as nitric oxide production. In vitro studies of human endothelial cells demonstrate that estrogen can inhibit cytokine-induced apoptosis.670 In the rat, MPA blocked the estrogen-induced healing response after carotid artery injuries.671

***Inhibition of Macrophage Foam Cell Formation***

A feature of atherosclerotic plaque formation is monocytic infiltration into the arterial wall and the formation of macrophage foam cells. In a non-antioxidant activity, estrogen inhibits macrophage foam cell accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions.672

***Reduction of Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme and Renin Levels***

Although oral estrogen, but not transdermal estrogen, increases angiotensinogen levels, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and renin levels are decreased (with or without progestin) by both routes of administration.673,674 The angiotensin II receptor (AT1 receptor) is involved in vasoconstriction, aldosterone release, sodium and water retention, and growth and proliferation of myocardial and vascular cells. Estrogen induces downregulation of the AT1 receptor, and hypercholesterolemia is associated

with AT1 upregulation and function.675,676

***Reduction of Adhesion Molecules***

Adhesion molecules recruit leukocytes to the endothelium and play a role in attaching platelets to the endothelium. Studies with multiple markers report that oral ET increases CRP, the only marker synthesized in the liver; however, it reduces the circulating levels of other markers (E-selectin, P-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor-a) with inconsistent effects on IL-6.53,54,677,678 An increase in CRP levels may be due to estrogen’s well-known effect to stimulate the hepatic synthesis of proteins, especially because of the first-pass phenomenon with oral administration. For this reason, transdermal estrogen treatment reduces adhesion markers but does not change CRP levels.679-681

***Reduction of Homocysteine***

Increased circulating levels of homocysteine are correlated with increased risks of atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Homocysteine levels increase after menopause and are associated with hypertension and a degree of atherosclerosis.682 Homocysteine levels are significantly lowered by estrogen or estrogen-progestin treatment, administered either orally or transdermally.683,684

***Reduction in Cellular Senescence***

*Cell senescence* refers to a state of cell cycle arrest and occurs in response to various stressors.685 Expression of the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, cell cycle arrest factors, senescence-associated β-galactosidase, morphogenesis, and chromatin remodeling are some of the biologic features of senescent cells. Persistent cellular senescence is associated with pathologies including aging.685,686 Several markers of cell senescence were analyzed in a secondary analysis in Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS), a RCT of oral CEE versus transdermal estradiol versus placebo (discussed later in this chapter under Menopausal Hormone Use and Cardiovascular Disease: Primary Prevention Randomized Clinical Trials Addressing the Timing Hypothesis); a reduction in several senescence markers (eg, macrophage inflammatory protein-1a) was observed in both oral CEE and transdermal estradiol, with a greater reduction seen with oral therapy. The authors attribute their observations to differences in circulating estrogen metabolites due to differences in the estrogen formulations and in their mode of delivery and suggested that their findings allow for generation of new hypotheses with regard to the effects of menopause on the biology of aging.687

**Menopausal Hormone Use and Cardiovascular Disease: Evidence From Observational Studies**

A review of case-control studies in the literature finds overwhelming support for about a 50% reduced risk of CHD in estrogen users.688-705 In three studies of women undergoing angiography, a comparison of coronary artery occlusion in users and nonusers of estrogen indicated a significant protective effect of postmenopausal estrogen.697-699 Women using HT at the time of a myocardial infarction or with congestive heart failure have been

reported to have an improved rate of survival.706,707 Little attention has been given to peripheral artery disease, but one case-control study did report a decrease in risk in users of HT.708

In a large number of cohort studies, most uniformly reported a reduction in CHD in estrogen users; only three produced conflicting data.709-724 In the Nurses’ Health Study with 20 years of follow-up, the age-adjusted relative risk (RR) of coronary disease in current users of HT was 39% reduced (RR

\= 0.61; CI \= 0.52-0.71).725 The benefit was observed with both the 0.625-and the 0.3-mg doses of conjugated estrogens. The beneficial impact was observed to diminish beginning 3 years after discontinuation. It was suggested that higher doses might be harmful because there was an apparent increase in the risk of coronary disease among women taking more than 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens per day. Current postmenopausal hormone users in the Nurses’ Health Study have had a 37% reduced risk of mortality due largely to protection against CHD, an effect that was still present after adjusting for dietary factors, alcohol intake, vitamin or aspirin use, and exercise.720

Electron beam tomography (also called ultrafast computed tomography \[CT\]) can assess for the presence of coronary artery disease by quantifying the amount of calcium in the coronary arteries, a measure that is known to correlate with the degree of disease and the risk of coronary events. Studies using this technique have demonstrated a lower prevalence of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in women younger than age 60, a prevalence comparable to men (of any age) in women older than 60, and less calcium (and, therefore, less coronary artery disease) in women using postmenopausal HT compared with nonusers.726,727 In women with an average age of 59 who had used HT for an average of 9 years, coronary artery calcification was significantly reduced, with a greater effect observed with increasing duration of use.728 This salutary effect of estrogen was confirmed in a substudy of the WHI estrogen-only arm.729

These observational studies have been criticized by arguing that estrogen treatment is a marker for variables (eg, better diet and better health care) that place postmenopausal estrogen users in a low-risk group for CVD (the “healthy user” effect). Moreover, indeed, women who choose to use HT have been reported to have a better cardiovascular risk profile than nonusers.730 This question was addressed by the Lipid Research Clinics

Study, the Leisure World Study, and the Nurses’ Health Study.713,731,732 These epidemiologists concluded that their evidence strongly indicated that in women receiving estrogen treatment who have the same risk factors for CVD as those not receiving treatment, the same beneficial effect of estrogen was present. This is especially the case in the Nurses’ Health Study, in which the participants are of a relatively homogeneous socioeconomic group. A cohort follow-up study in Southeastern New England documented similar levels of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, BMI, and blood pressure in estrogen users and nonusers, indicating that selection of significantly more healthy women for estrogen use could not fully explain the beneficial effect of estrogen on the risk of CVD.733 In a comparison of health variables among users and nonusers in South Australia, there was no evidence to support the presence of a “healthy user” effect.734 In Chile, users and nonusers of HT had identical risk factors for CVD.735

In contrast to the uniform results from observational studies of the association between postmenopausal HT and CHD, epidemiologic data over the last 30 years regarding estrogen use and stroke have not been consistent. The many studies have indicated either a small increase or no effect of postmenopausal HT on the risk of stroke or a reduction in risk associated with estrogen or estrogen-progestin use.711,713,719,725,736-745 A prospective cohort study in Denmark recorded an increase in ischemic strokes, but *only* among women with hypertension, and a large cohort study from Sweden found no link between stroke and HT.746,747

Within this confusing mixture of results on stroke, there was one consistent observation. The cohort studies (with a sufficient number of cases) that have assessed the impact of hormone use on the risk of death from stroke have all indicated a beneficial impact. For example, the NHANES recruited a very large cohort of women in 1971 to 1975 for epidemiologic analysis. The follow-up longitudinal study of this cohort yielded a US national sample of 1,910 White postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal hormone use in this cohort provided a 31% reduction in stroke incidence and a strongly significant 63% reduction in stroke mortality.740 These RRs were present even after adjusting for age, hypertension, diabetes, body weight, smoking, socioeconomic status, and previous CVD. This study specifically addressed the criticism that one should expect less disease in estrogen users because they are healthier.

After adjusting for physical activity as a marker of general health status, the risk estimates remained identical.

Hypertension is both a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and a common problem in older people. Studies have either shown no effect or a small, but statistically significant, decrease in blood pressure due to estrogen treatment.748-753 This has been the case in both women who are normotensive and hypertensive.754-759 The addition of a progestin did not affect this response.111,760 Discontinuing HT in women with hypertension does not result in a decrease in blood pressure (an expected response if the treatment were raising blood pressure), and in some patients, discontinuation is followed by an increase in blood pressure.761 The acute administration of estrogen to women with hypertension is followed by decreases in blood pressure, pulse rate, and circulating levels of norepinephrine.762 **The very rare cases of increased blood pressure due to oral ET truly represent idiosyncratic reactions. Blood pressure should be assessed every 6 months in women with hypertension being treated with postmenopausal hormones, and if the blood pressure is labile, blood pressure should be measured every 3 months.**

Observational studies have also reported that hormone users have a decreased risk of developing venous leg ulcers or pressure ulcers.763,764

**Menopausal Hormone Use and Cardiovascular Disease: Evidence From Clinical Trials**

***The Women’s Health Initiative***

The WHI was organized by the NIH in 1992 to study the health of postmenopausal women and was scheduled to be completed in 2007\.765 From 1993 to 1998, the WHI enrolled 161,809 women aged 50 to 79 years in 40 clinical centers. The major components of the WHI were (1) two randomized trials of postmenopausal HT scheduled to conclude in 2005, (2) a dietary modification trial that randomized 48,000 women to either a sustained low-fat or a self-determined diet, (3) a calcium/vitamin D supplementation trial, and (4) an observational study. One of the randomized trials of postmenopausal HT, the combined estrogen-progestin arm (daily 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5-mg MPA), randomized 16,608 women to either treatment or placebo. The other hormone trial, an

estrogen-only arm (daily 0.625 mg conjugated estrogens), randomized 10,739 hysterectomized women to treatment or placebo.

On May 31, 2002, the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) made its periodic review of the data accumulated by the WHI. The DSMB made two recommendations that were announced on July 9, 2002: (1) to discontinue the trial arm administering daily estrogen-progestin and (2) to continue the trial arm with daily unopposed estrogen in hysterectomized women. The combined estrogen-progestin arm was discontinued after about 5 years of follow-up because of a statistically significant increase in invasive breast cancer and an increase in cardiovascular events.766 The statistical parameters for benefit or harm were established in 1997, early in the study. When the increase in breast cancer exceeded the predetermined boundary, the DSMB was obligated to recommend discontinuation of this arm of the trial.

On March 2, 2004, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the NIH canceled the estrogen-only arm of the WHI. This arm of the WHI included 10,739 hysterectomized, postmenopausal women who had completed an average of 6.8 years of follow-up. The WHI DSMB made their last periodic review of the study data in December 2003\. The DSMB was not unanimous in its decision; some members wanted to stop the study, and others wanted the study to continue after sending a letter to the participants describing the findings. Even though none of the findings had crossed the predefined boundaries, the NIH made the decision to stop the study on February 2, 2004\. The decision was based on the following results767:
