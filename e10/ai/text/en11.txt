* An increased risk of stroke similar to that reported in the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI

* No increase or decrease in CHD

* A trend toward an increased risk of probable dementia and/or mild cognitive impairment

* A reduction in hip fractures

* No increase in breast cancer

**With the exception of breast cancer and CHD, the results in the estrogen-only arm were essentially identical to those in the estrogen-progestin arm of the study.** However, keep in mind that the populations in the two clinical, randomized trial arms of the WHI were not identical.768 Considering risk factors for CVD, the women in the estrogen-only arm were more obese, were less active, and had more preexisting CVD. The estrogen-only arm also differed in regard to risk factors for breast cancer: more early births and bilateral oophorectomy and more and longer duration of previous HT. **Therefore, these were two different trials with two different populations and treatments, making direct comparisons inappropriate.**

**The published results of the WHI trial agree with more than 30 years of case-control and cohort data with the exception** (**as first presented by the WHI**) **of the cardiovascular results.** The updated results on the risk of CHD from the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI reflected central adjudication of the cardiac diagnoses in contrast to the initial report that relied on local diagnoses.769 The final report covered an average of 5.6 years of follow-up, compared with 5.2 years in the initial report. Based on these data, there would be an increase of six cases of CHD per 10,000 women per year in the treated group.

Central adjudication disagreed with 10% of the diagnoses for myocardial infarction and 3% for death due to CHD. This small degree of disagreement changed the strength of the conclusions comparing the initial report766 with the updated report. Indeed, the overall results by definition did not achieve statistical significance in the follow-up report, and only the first-year results were statistically significant in the year-by-year analysis, a conclusion based on a difference of only 19 cases. In all of the WHI reports, the intent-to-treat analyses were adjusted for multiple outcomes, by the Bonferroni adjustment. All adjusted results were not statistically significant. It is difficult to understand the clinical meaning of this manipulation, but most believe that this indicates a slightly lower mathematical conclusion than presented in the nonadjusted data. This, of course, would further weaken the power of the reported results.

Consider also the possibility of diagnostic bias. In all, 40.5% of the estrogen-progestin group in the WHI (nearly 5,000/8,500 in the treated group), in contrast to 6.8% of the placebo group, were unblinded because of

vaginal bleeding. What was the impact on the clinicians’ final management and diagnosis when told that the patient is in the WHI study and experiencing vaginal bleeding? This problem affects the data not only in regard to CVD but also for breast cancer. Unblinding was not a problem in the estrogen-only arm of the WHI and no increase in CHD was recorded—was this because of an absence of diagnostic bias in the estrogen-only arm?

The characteristics of the participants in the two WHI hormone trials are noted in **Table 22.6**.

WHI, Women’s Health Initiative.

**The women in the estrogen-progestin arm were an average of slightly more than 12 years distant from menopause.**767 **Most had been without HT for more than a decade. In the estrogen-only arm, the published results do not specify the number of years distant from menopause, but this duration may have been even greater, influenced by the age of subjects at the time of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.** Women with significant menopausal symptoms were excluded from the study to avoid an exceedingly high drop-out rate in the placebo group. Women who had been on HT (about 25% of the participants in the estrogen-progestin arm and 35% in the estrogen-only arm) and then underwent a 3-month “washout” period and experienced menopausal symptoms were discouraged from participation. (\~12.5% of the participants in the estrogen-progestin arm reported VMS on entry but were willing to be assigned to placebo, and, therefore, their symptoms were unlikely to have had a major disturbing effect.) This exclusion means that only a small number of women in the WHI were close to their age of menopause. (About

16.5% of the participants in the estrogen-progestin arm were \<5 years since their menopause.) For example, there was only a total of 574 women aged 50 to 54 years in the estrogen-progestin arm.770

Over the time of the studies, the participants discontinued their medication at a consistently increasing rate so that at termination, about half were no longer adhering to treatment. The WHI investigators argued that the high drop-out rate could lead to an underestimation of adverse effects; however, this would not be the case if longer duration of treatment exerts a beneficial effect. For example, a case-control study in the United Kingdom found a significant reduction in the risk of myocardial infarction only with the use of HT for more than 5 years.771 Indeed, a trend for an emerging protection against CHD was observed in both arms of the WHI with increasing duration of treatment. Analysis of subsamples in the WHI revealed that the treated group had greater reductions in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, glucose, and insulin levels and greater increases in HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. It is tempting to link these findings with the test for trend that revealed a favorable, decreasing RR of CHD over time, which was statistically significant. However, this analysis was hampered by decreasing numbers over time, and the conclusion was not a strong one.

**In subgroup analyses, only the women in the estrogen-progestin arm who were 20 years or more distant from menopause had a statistically significant increased risk of CHD. Subtracting this group from the rest of the participants, CHD now was observed in an identical prevalence comparing the treated and placebo groups. It is not appropriate to conclude, based on the WHI, that HT increases the risk of coronary clinical events in all postmenopausal women; this conclusion can only be applied to a specific older group of women. Indeed, as early as 2004, the data from the estrogen-only arm suggested that younger women experienced a reduced risk of CHD with estrogen treatment.**767

A reanalysis of the CHD data in the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI, published 7 years after the initial report, contributed nothing new, confirming that a statistically significant increase in coronary heart events occurred only in those women who were 10 years or more distant from onset of menopause.772 An excellent review from 2022 has placed in

perspective the lessons learned from and since the WHI hormone trials and offers reassurance toward safety of HT for chronologically younger population of otherwise healthy perimenopausal and early menopausal women.773

One response to the publications from the WHI has been a scientific and clinical effort to assess and use lower doses of estrogen. Half of the standard dose of CEEs has been demonstrated to effectively treat menopausal symptoms and to prevent bone loss. It is reasonable to ask whether symptoms and bone are especially sensitive to the effects of estrogen and whether lower doses of estrogen will beneficially impact other target tissues. The cardiovascular system is of obvious concern because it was already apparent that lower doses of estrogen do have a lesser effect on circulating lipids and lipoproteins.

Clarkson and his colleagues studied the effects of a lower dose estrogen trial in a monkey model of coronary atherosclerosis.774 The animals were fed an atherogenic diet for 10 months, calculated to induce atherosclerosis comparable to that observed in early postmenopausal women. After oophorectomy, the animals were randomized to treatment for 2 years with a placebo or a dose of CEEs equivalent to 0.3 mg/d in women. This dose had no effect on circulating lipid levels; nevertheless, the treated animals had an average of 52% reduction in coronary atherosclerosis. This degree of protection was similar to studies in this model using a dose of conjugated estrogens equivalent to 0.625 mg/d.

The reliability and value of results obtained in Clarkson et al’s monkey model have stood the test of time. Repeatedly, the results from this model proved to be predictive of hormonal effects in women. Therefore, this experiment using a lower dose of estrogen is important, providing information regarding the effect of a lower dose on coronary atherosclerosis. Consistent with some reports in women, the lower dose of estrogen had no effect on levels of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or triglycerides. However, the treatment markedly reduced the extent of coronary artery atherosclerosis, a further indication that estrogen-induced inhibition of atherosclerosis occurs to a large extent independently of changes in lipids and lipoproteins. In the dose-response clinical trial that led to FDA approval of lower doses of CEEs, the 0.3-mg dose still

produced statistically significant beneficial changes in lipids and lipoproteins, and this dose prevented bone loss.119,125

***The Women’s Health Initiative and Stroke***

The WHI reported an overall increase in the estrogen-progestin arm of ischemic stroke, but no increase in fatal strokes.766,775 The increase in nonfatal ischemic stroke in the estrogen-only arm of the WHI was of similar magnitude.747,776 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled secondary prevention trial (the WEST trial) of daily 1 mg estradiol therapy was conducted in postmenopausal women after a recent (within 90 days) ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (25% of the women).777 After an average of 2.8 years of follow-up (range 16-50 months), there were no significant overall differences comparing the treatment and placebo groups in any of the assessed outcomes, including nonfatal stroke, fatal stroke, coronary death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or transient ischemic attack. The WEST trial retrospectively analyzed the time course of cerebrovascular events and found a significantly increased risk of stroke only at 6 months based on 21 strokes in the estradiol group and 9 strokes in the placebo group.

A major limitation of the WEST study was the reduced compliance with treatment because of the problems associated with unopposed estrogen treatment. Over a 3-year period, 116 women in the estradiol group discontinued treatment (34%) compared with 79 in the placebo group (24%). **Nevertheless, the clinical meaning is straightforward: Patients should not be given estrogen treatment after a vascular event in the expectation that recurrent vascular events would be prevented by the initiation of estrogen treatment. However, this recommendation is specifically targeted to women with existing vascular disease.**

The Nurses’ Health Study reported an update of its data on the use of HT and stroke, focusing on the timing of initiation of treatment and the effect of estrogen doses.778 In the analyses adjusted for age, BMI, cholesterol levels, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and family history of early CHD, the following RRs were observed for ischemic stroke (there was no significant increase in hemorrhagic stroke):

**Current use of estrogen alone:** RR \= 1.43 (CI \= 1.17-1.74)

**Current use of estrogen-progestin:** RR \= 1.53 (CI \= 1.21-1.95)

Comparing the initiation of HT near menopause with initiation 10 years or more after menopause, there was no major difference.

The Nurses’ Health Study also reported an increasing risk of stroke with an increasing dose of estrogen (**Table 22.7**).

**It is not easy to derive a take-home message from the Nurses’ Health Study report. The authors stated that their findings are “virtually identical to those of the WHI trials.” However, in the last report from the WHI, when women with prior CVD or those older than 60 years were excluded, the risk of stroke with hormone use in women less than 10 years since their menopause was not significantly increased.**779 **Therefore, there is disagreement.**

| TABLE 22.7	Estrogen Dose and Stroke Risk |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **0.3-mg estrogen** | **25 cases** | **RR \= 0.93 (CI \= 0.62-1.40)** |
| 0.625 mg | 268 cases | RR \= 1.54 (CI \= 1.31-1.81) |
| 1.25 mg | 60 cases | RR \= 1.62 (CI \= 1.23-2.14) |

CI, confidence interval; RR, relative risk.

**In women with risk factors for stroke, it is prudent to use low doses of estrogen and to vigorously address the risk factors, such as effective treatment of hypertension. Would the transdermal route of hormone administration be safer? This is an important question that cannot be categorically answered because of the lack of high-quality prospective data. However, as has been discussed earlier in this chapter, it is quite plausible that transdermal HT confers a lower risk of thrombosis compared to oral formulations. Therefore, it seems wise to preferentially recommend transdermal route of HT for older postmenopausal hormone users.**

**Secondary Prevention Randomized Clinical Trials**

***The Heart and Estrogen-Progestin Replacement Study***

HERS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to determine whether daily treatment with 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5-mg MPA would reduce CHD events in women with preexisting coronary disease.780-782 In this trial, 2,763 women (average age 66.7 years) were enrolled in 20 US clinical centers and randomized to treatment and placebo beginning in February 1993 and ending in July 1998\. Overall, there were 172 myocardial infarctions and coronary deaths in the hormone group and 176 in the placebo group—no difference.

At baseline, the use of statins and aspirin was essentially equally prevalent in the treated and placebo groups (about 40% of the subjects used statins and 80% used aspirin). However, more women in the placebo group began treatment with statins so that by the end of the follow-up period, the 69% versus 65% difference comparing placebo with treatment was statistically significant. The authors addressed this potential confounder by adjusting for the difference in statin use (as well as other confounders) and concluded that the adjusted analyses were essentially identical to the original analyses. However, no mention is made of the fact that the percentage use of statin use is impressively high. What if any beneficial effect of estrogen is lost because of the impact of statin therapy? Indeed, in a primary prevention trial, inhibition of atherosclerosis with estrogen treatment was observed only in women *not* receiving statins.783 The HERS investigators compared CHD events in the hormone group with the placebo group in women not using statins or aspirin and found no difference, but this very important possible explanation for the lack of a beneficial effect of estrogen in HERS cannot be answered by the analysis of the HERS data because statin and aspirin treatments were not randomized and the number of events in women not on statins or aspirin was very small.

Of the 2,763 postmenopausal women in the HERS trial, 2,321 (93%) agreed to be involved in additional follow-up evaluation, HERS II. The original study780 lasted 4.1 years, and the average extended follow-up equaled 2.7 years, for a mean total of 6.8 years. At the beginning of the follow-up period, the average age of the participants was 71 (67 at baseline and 74 at closure). The investigators could detect no significant differences in  the  rates  of  coronary  events  or  secondary  cardiovascular  events

comparing the treated group with the placebo group. There was no statistical trend for a beneficial effect of HT with longer duration of treatment. Because of the absence of a difference, the follow-up period, scheduled to last 4 years, was terminated early.

The additional follow-up period was unblinded; patients and physicians could choose to continue, discontinue, or initiate HT or other therapy. Hormone use in the original treated group in HERS declined from 81% after 1 year to 45% during the sixth year (and 11% were using preparations other than the original 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5-mg MPA). During the sixth year, 8% of the placebo group were now receiving HT. Raloxifene or tamoxifen had even been initiated, 3% in the hormone group and 4% in the placebo group. The investigators recognized this problem conceding that their power to detect an increasing benefit was eroded by the changing treatments; however, their analysis indicated an ability to detect at least an 18% reduction in cardiac risk.

The original HERS report indicated a 2- to 3-fold increase in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in the hormone-treated group. In the follow-up period, there was no longer a statistically significant increase in deep vein thrombosis. There was no reduction in pulmonary embolism, but the number of events was too small to provide accurate assessment. The event rates for venous thrombosis were 5.9 per 1,000 women per year of treatment and 2.8 in the placebo group. Overall, there was a 48% increase in risk for biliary tract surgery in the treated group, 6 more cases per 1,000 women per year compared with placebo.

Intention-to-treat analysis compares all individuals in the treated group to all in the placebo group, regardless of individual compliance or completion of the study. Proponents argue that this is the best method of analysis for clinical trials because it reflects the full impact of randomization. Opponents contend that this method is intuitively wrong; how can the long-term benefit of a treatment be assessed if subjects receiving treatment for only a short period of time are included? HERS II performed an “as-treated” analysis, focusing on women with 80% or more compliance, and found relative hazards (RHs) (like RR) similar to those in the intent-to-treat analysis. However, the RH in the as-treated analysis for primary CHD events in HERS II was reduced, although not statistically significant (RH \= 0.81; CI \= 0.52-1.32). Events were fewer in the as-treated

analyses because only 37% of the events qualified. Adjustment for statin use was performed only in the intent-to-treat analysis (“only a trivial effect on the findings”). The HERS clinical trial results that reflect intent-to-treat analyses are compromised by a difficulty in detecting a long-term effect, and the results that reflect the as-treated analysis are compromised by few events because of compliance and drop-out problems. Therefore, unanswered questions remain: whether reported increases in cardiovascular events early after the initiation of HT reflect a true risk of HT or the effect of reduced events in the placebo groups because of new-onset treatment with statins and aspirin, or an effect limited to women with significant preexisting coronary artery disease.

***Other Secondary Prevention Trials***

The results of a multicenter trial (the Estrogen Replacement and Atherosclerosis \[ERA\] trial) examined the effect of postmenopausal HT on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by angiography.784 A total of 309 women were randomly assigned to receive either unopposed estrogen, 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens per day; a daily combination of estrogen and progestin, 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5-mg MPA; or placebo. Over 3.5 years of treatment, angiography did not detect any differences in disease progression between any of the groups. The women in this study had documented heart disease on entry and were a relatively older group of women (mean age 65.8 years). Half had a previous myocardial infarction. There were no reported increases in cardiac events in any of the three treatment groups.

The ERA trial joins the HERS trial in demonstrating no secondary preventive effect of postmenopausal HT on older women with significant CHD. However, in **comparing the two trials, there is an important observation. The ERA trial contained an estrogen-only arm, and the absence of a difference between the estrogen-only arm and the estrogen-progestin arm argues against a negative effect due to the daily administration of MPA.**

Another secondary prevention, 3-year trial (Women’s Estrogen-progestin Lipid-Lowering Hormone Atherosclerosis Regression Trial, WELL-HART) assessed whether unopposed estradiol or a sequential regimen  of  estradiol  and  MPA  could  slow  the  progression  of

atherosclerosis.785 The double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involved 226 postmenopausal women with an average age of 63.5 years (range 48-75), who already had at least one demonstrated coronary artery lesion. The results were based on follow-up angiograms in 59 women in the placebo group, 54 in the estradiol group, and 53 in the estradiol/MPA group. A reduction of LDL cholesterol to less than 130 mg/dL was achieved by dietary intervention, but coronary angiography to measure the change from baseline in the percent stenosis failed to demonstrate a difference among the groups receiving placebo; unopposed, daily 1 mg estradiol; or daily 1 mg estradiol and 12 days each month of 5 mg MPA. **There were also no differences in cardiovascular events during treatment. The results indicated that MPA administered in a sequential regimen is not associated with an adverse cardiovascular effect.**

At least three other secondary prevention trials in women with CHD failed to demonstrate a beneficial impact of HT.786-788 These various trials tested oral conjugated estrogens, oral estradiol valerate, and transdermal estradiol combined with either MPA or norethindrone. **The results of the secondary prevention trials in older women with established heart disease are uniformly consistent in finding no beneficial effects of HT, and the data indicate that different estrogens and different progestins behave similarly.**

**The Timing Hypothesis**

The timing hypothesis argues that estrogen can reduce the risk of CHD when administered to relatively young postmenopausal women before atherosclerosis has developed to the stage of unstable plaques (plaques with necrosis and inflammation).

The WHI investigators conducted a secondary analysis of the two canceled clinical hormone trial arms.779 The results in the estrogen-only arm, in the combined estrogen-progestin arm, and with the participants combined were separated into age groups at randomization (50-59, 60-69, and 70-79) and according to years since menopause (\<10, 10-19, and ≥20). **An increased risk for CHD was present only in the oldest women in the trials. There were no increases for CHD, stroke, or total mortality in women aged 50 to 59 years. In fact, only the increase in CHD events in**

**women 20**\+ **years since menopause reached statistical significance. There was no apparent increase in CVD risk in treated women close to their menopause. Indeed, a statistically significant reduced risk was present for total mortality in women aged 50 to 59 years.**

The data in this 2007 WHI report were not new. A careful reading of the initial adjudicated reports reveals that the risk of CHD was present only in the oldest women in the trials.769,789 In subgroup analyses, the only significant increase in stroke occurred in the estrogen-only arm in women aged 60 to 69 years. However, as noted previously, when women with prior CVD or those older than 60 years were excluded, the risk of stroke in women less than 10 years since their menopause was not significantly increased. In a meta-analysis of RCTs examining CHD outcomes when HT was used in younger versus older women, lower CHD was noted in the younger group.790 To further assess the effects of ET on coronary health, CAC was measured in women aged 50 to 59 years by CT. Calcium atheromas are indicative of the chronic inflammatory process associated with atherosclerosis and are the best known predictors of clinical heart disease. As such, calcium atheroma scores were used to assess CVD. Women in the ET group had a statistically significant lower calcium atheroma score than those in the placebo group (*P* \= 0.02). Moreover, in participants with greater than 80% adherence (to ET or placebo), there was a 61% lower risk of severe coronary calcium in the ET group (*P* \= 0.002).790 Will postmenopausal HT begun at or near the time of the menopause, and maintained for a relatively long duration of time, provide protection against coronary artery disease (primary prevention)? The design of the canceled arms of the WHI did not allow an answer to this question. As noted previously, women with significant menopausal symptoms were excluded from the study to avoid an exceedingly high drop-out rate in the placebo group. The WHI addressed this problem by pointing out that the ratios of cardiovascular events in the treated and placebo arms were the same when assessed by decades of age, 50s, 60s, and 70s. However, this was not the critical analysis. It is very likely that a small number of the participants were close to their age of menopause. Only 574 in both the treated and placebo groups were age 50 to 54 in the estrogen-progestin arm, and it is likely that even some of these women were relatively distant from their menopause. Even with the appropriate analysis according to years

from menopause, the results are limited by very small numbers of women in their early postmenopausal years. Furthermore, the high drop-out rates in these clinical trials erode the statistical power for assessing year-by-year new statin or aspirin treatment.

There is a small primary prevention trial of 199 healthy postmenopausal women randomized to a daily dose of 1 mg estradiol or placebo and followed for 2 years measuring with ultrasonography the change in cIMT.783 The women receiving estradiol had a small decrease in intimal-media thickness in contrast to a marked increase in the placebo group. Interestingly, in those participants taking lipid-lowering medications, there was no difference comparing estrogen treatment with placebo (both groups had a small decrease in thickness), indicating that lipid-lowering drugs and estrogen had similar beneficial effects on atherosclerosis that were not additive. There have been two other similar ultrasonography studies. A 2-year Dutch study did not achieve a significant difference comparing treatment with placebo, but the results were handicapped by a very high drop-out rate and problems with follow-up.791 A German study that found no effect of HT enrolled women who already had increased intimal-media thickness, and the duration of the study was only 1 year.792

A meta-analysis of 23 randomized HT trials concluded that treatment reduced the risk of CHD events by 32% in younger women compared with older women (≥10 years since menopause or \>60 years of age).793 This is a conclusion that is less firm than at first apparent, because most of these trials were not designed to measure an end point of CVD. However, another meta-analysis by the same authors concluded that HT reduced overall mortality in women with an average age of less than 60\.794 There is a growing story that adequate estrogen exposure prior to the onset of clinical events provides protection against CVD.

The timing hypothesis originated in the hormone trials conducted in monkeys by the Wake-Forest group headed by Tom Clarkson and provides some of the initial support of the timing hypothesis.795

* Estrogen treatment initiated immediately after menopause in monkeys inhibited progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis by about 70%. When treatment was delayed by 2 years (equivalent to about 6 years in women), there was no effect.795  
* Next in line, according to strength of evidence in our view, would be he WHI reports of

reduced CAC in estrogen-treated women and an increase in cardiac events only in the oldest women in the trials.729,779 The problem of low event rates in younger women in the WHI was addressed by lumping together, in one HR, myocardial infarction, coronary death, coronary revascularization, and confirmed angina—the risk in women aged 50 to 59 years for all of these events was significantly reduced (HR \= 0.66; CI \=

0.45-0.96).789 In addition, the WHI measured CAC in a substudy of the estrogen-only arm and found that women with bilateral oophorectomies who were not treated with estrogen had an increase in subclinical CHD.796

* Every woman has a trajectory of atherosclerosis development, the slope of which determines the age of onset for clinical events. Premenopausal women with lower estrogen levels have higher cardiovascular risk factors and develop more and earlier CHD.797

* The importance of premenopausal estrogen is also supported by Clarkson et al’s monkey studies. Premenopausal monkeys with normal ovarian function have less progression of coronary artery atherosclerosis as compared with monkeys with impaired ovarian function.795  
* The Mayo Clinic Cohort Study of Oophorectomy and Aging included 1,274 premenopausal women with unilateral oophorectomy (followed up for a median of 29.5 years) and 1,091 premenopausal women with bilateral oophorectomy (followed up for a median of 25 years) who had surgery from 1950 to 1987, compared with 2,383 matched women from the same population of women who had not undergone oophorectomy.798 Women with bilateral oophorectomy before age 45 had about a 5-fold increase in risk of mortality for neurologic or mental diseases and experienced almost a 2-fold increase in

mortality from CVD, increased risks of parkinsonism, cognitive impairment and dementia, and an increase in depressive and anxiety symptoms later in life (**Figure 22.7**).799-802

* The Nurses’ Health Study compared, after 24 years of follow-up, ovarian conservation (13,035 women) and bilateral oophorectomy (16,345 women) at the time of premenopausal hysterectomy.803 *An all-cause increase in mortality, CHD, and stroke was observed in those women who never used estrogen after surgery; this amounted to one additional death for every nine surgeries.*  
* The results in observational studies strongly indicate that hormone treatment of young postmenopausal women reduces the risk of CHD. In the Nurses’ Health Study, the reduction was approximately 50%.725 The women in the Nurses’ Health Study who were under age 60 when hormone treatment was initiated had a significant reduction in CHD risk compared with no effect in women over age 60\.804 A similar reduction was present in the observational arm of the WHI.805 In fact, after adjustment for confounding influences in the WHI observational arm such as behavioral, dietary, physical activity, and cardiovascular risk factors, the RRs for cardiovascular events were 30% to 38% lower than in the clinical trials. These data were derived from populations of women usually treated with postmenopausal HT, women close to their natural age of menopause.

***Primary Prevention Randomized Clinical Trials Addressing the Timing Hypothesis***

**KEEPS** was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial aimed at assessing the effects of early initiation of oral or transdermal HT on progression rates of subclinical atherosclerosis.806 Women were eligible for enrollment if they were healthy, aged 42 to 58 years, between 6 and 36 months from their last menstrual period with no prior CVD events, a CAC score less than 50 Agatston units, and without exogenous estrogen exposure or lipid-lowering therapy for the past 90 days. Women were randomized to receive oral (o) CEE 0.45 mg/d or transdermal (t) E2 50 μg/d, each with 200 mg oral progesterone for 12 days per month, or placebo for 48 months. The primary end point was annual change in cIMT by ultrasonography, with secondary end points of changes in markers of CVD risk, including CAC scores (determined by CT scan of the chest).806 Of the 727 randomized women, 89.3% had at least one follow-up cIMT, while 79.8% had a cIMT annually. The KEEPS trial found that the mean cIMT increase of 0.007

mm/y was similar among all three groups. Similarly, the percentage of subjects in whom CAC scores increased was not different. LDL and HDL levels improved, levels of CRP and SHBG increased with o-CEE, but IL-6 did not. Insulin resistance decreased with t-E2; there were no changes in blood pressure with either o-CEE or t-E2 use.806 Thus, the KEEPS trial did not demonstrate a significant difference in cIMT (a measure of preclinical progression of atherosclerosis) among oral, transdermal, or placebo groups. In a follow-up of a subgroup of subjects (representative of the placebo, o-CEE, and t-E2 groups) 3 years after stopping HT from the KEEPS trial, the effects of cessation of HT on cIMT were analyzed.807 There did not appear to be a “rebound” effect on cIMT progression upon discontinuation of o-CEE or t-E2.807 Regardless of HT regimen, there was an overall increase in cIMT over time, which may be inherent to the aging process.807 A secondary analysis of the KEEPS trial analyzed how oral versus transdermal HT affected epicardial and pericardial fat deposits, which have an association with the progression of coronary artery calcifications. Cardiac fat deposits were not impacted by o-CEE; however, an increase in pericardial fat was observed in t-E2. Clinical implications of these observations remain unclear, and future studies are needed to establish if indeed pericardial fat deposits are differentially affected by route of ET, and clinical consequences therefrom.

**ELITE** also assessed the effect of early administration of HT on the development/progression of atherosclerosis.808 Six hundred and forty-three healthy postmenopausal women are stratified by years since menopause (early equal to \<6 years or late \[\>10 years\]) and randomly assigned to oral E2 1 mg/d plus vaginal progesterone 45 mg for 10 days per month for women with a uterus or placebo (including sequential vaginal gel for subjects with a uterus). The primary outcome was the rate of change in cIMT (measured every 6 months). Secondary outcomes included assessment of coronary artery atherosclerosis by cardiac CT scan (performed at the completion of study medication). Following 5 years, it was found that oral E2 with/without vaginal progesterone resulted in a significantly slower increase in cIMT in the early postmenopause group, compared to placebo.808 In women who were greater than 10 years past menopause, cIMT progression rates were not different from placebo. Measures of CAC by CT, total stenosis, and plaque burden did not differ
