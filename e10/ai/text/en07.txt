Overall, metabolic effects of raloxifene are neutral or even favorable on lipids.209-212 The Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) study of raloxifene administration to women with osteoporosis reported results from 8 years of follow-up.213,214 Women with low *T*\-scores had approximately a 50% reduction in vertebral fractures with raloxifene treatment and those with previous vertebral fractures had an approximate 35% reduction compared to placebo. However, **there has been no evidence of a reduction in hip or wrist fractures.** The major adverse effect was about a 3-fold increase in VTE. All SERMs, like estrogen, have an increased risk for VTE, normally within the first 1 to 2 years of drug initiation.215 The size of the risk is comparable for all SERMs, and nearly all the cases occur in the first 1 or 2 years of exposure. A small number of women experience hot flushing with raloxifene. Raloxifene treatment in the MORE trial had neither a positive nor a negative effect on cognition.216

Women who received raloxifene in the MORE trial had about an 80% reduction in the incidence of ER-positive breast cancers. The CORE study, the Continuing Outcomes Relevant to Evista trial, was designed to measure the impact of 4 additional years of raloxifene (60 mg/d), beginning during the fourth year of the MORE trial.217 Of the 7,705 participants initially randomized in the MORE trial, 3,510 women elected to continue raloxifene treatment (2,336 completed the CORE trial) and 1,703 continued on placebo (1,106 completed the trial). During the 4-year CORE study, raloxifene treatment was associated with a 66% (HR \= 0.34; CI \= 0.18-0.66) reduction of ER-positive invasive breast cancer in the treated group. There was no difference in ER-negative tumors, nor. Over the entire 8-year period, the reduction in ER-positive cancers reached 76%. In the 8-year period, there was no difference in the number of deaths in the two groups.

The Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial enrolled 19,747 women at increased risk of breast cancer who were randomized to treatment with either raloxifene, 60 mg daily, or tamoxifen, 20 mg daily, in more than 500 centers in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico.218 After an average treatment period of almost 4 years, the numbers of invasive breast cancers were identical in the two groups of women. It was estimated that these results were equivalent to about a 50% reduction (based on the previous results in the tamoxifen prevention trial),219,220 but without a placebo arm, an accurate assessment was impossible. Thus, raloxifene

appears to achieve the same reduction as tamoxifen in invasive breast cancers with a lesser increase in venous thrombosis and perhaps no increase in cataracts and uterine cancer. Fractures, as well as strokes and heart attacks, were equally prevalent in the two groups. “Quality of life” was said to be the same for both drugs.

Tamoxifen, another well-recognized SERM, has been demonstrated to reduce the incidence of both lobular carcinoma in situ and ductal carcinoma in situ.219,220 In the 7-year follow-up report of the tamoxifen for prevention study, the risk for breast cancer was 0.57 (CI \= 0.46-0.79), a 43% reduction, and the risk for in situ disease was 0.63 (CI \= 0.45-0.89), a 37% reduction.219 Not only did raloxifene not yield a reduction in in situ cancers, the number with raloxifene in the STAR trial was greater. If raloxifene is truly preventing breast cancer, this should produce a reduction in in situ disease. Perhaps, with longer follow-up, a difference between the two treatment groups will no longer be apparent.

In a 2-year randomized trial in monkeys, raloxifene exerted no protection against coronary artery atherosclerosis despite changes in circulating lipids similar to those achieved in women.221 The Raloxifene Use for the Heart (RUTH) study included more than 10,000 women from 26 countries, either at high risk for myocardial infarction or with known CHD.222,223 The participants were randomized to placebo or raloxifene, 60 mg daily, and followed for up to 7 years. There was no effect of raloxifene treatment on CHD events; however, there was a small increase in stroke mortality. The results of the RUTH trial are not surprising. The known favorable impact of raloxifene on the cholesterol-lipid profile was not robust enough to prevent coronary events.

Because the Nurses’ Health Study reported a reduction in coronary events associated with ET administered to young postmenopausal women, the RUTH trial performed a post hoc analysis of the impact of raloxifene according to age of the women at entry to the study as well as subgroups such as the use of medications, including statins.223 Overall, raloxifene did not increase or decrease coronary events in either of the treated groups. The only category demonstrating a significant difference, a 40% reduction in coronary events, consisted of women less than 60 years of age. Despite the statistically significant reduction in coronary events in women under age 60, there was no relationship in any subgroup according to years since

menopause, even in the group less than 10 years postmenopausal. The women who were less than 60 years of age were an average of 9.9 years since menopause, compared with 19.4 years for the overall study population. As with HT, decision to use raloxifene should not be influenced by its potential for facilitatory effects on the cardiovascular system, but rather for its beneficial impact on bone and breast tissue.

**In our view, raloxifene is an option for the prevention of osteoporosis-related spinal fractures, especially for patients reluctant to use HT or in those wanting to combine some bone protection with a reduction in the risk of breast cancer. If using raloxifene for bone protection, periodic evaluation of BMD at the hip is recommended, and if bone loss occurs, patient and clinician should consider an alternative treatment option.**

**Ospemifene**

Ospemifene (Osphena), the newest of these agents, has been approved by the FDA in the United States and Europe for its beneficial effects on vaginal tissue. As an oral formulation in a dose of 60 mg/d, it is effective in improving symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy sites where ospemifene exerts a significant estrogenic impact.224 In an action similar to sister SERM’s, ospemifene suppressed the development of breast cancer in a mouse model, and post hoc analysis of safety data is reassuring in terms of its effects on the breast, endometrium, and bone. Case studies offer reassurance regarding safety of ospemifene in managing symptoms of vulvovaginal atrophy in women with a history of breast cancer.225 However, similar to raloxifene, VMS can worsen.226 More recently, improvements in urinary urge incontinence and in sexual function were observed following a 12-week treatment with ospemifene in postmenopausal women with symptoms of overactive bladder syndrome.227

**Effect of Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators on the Skeleton**

These effects are discussed in Chapter 23\.

***Tissue-Selective Estrogen Complex***

**The combination of an estrogen combined with an SERM is called a TSEC** (**tissue-selective estrogen complex**)**.** The idea is to gain the benefits of estrogen (improved VMS, improved BMD, and reduced fracture risk) while mitigating potential for adverse effects of estrogen on certain end organs (such as the endometrium and the breast). A series of RCTs (Selective Estrogens, Menopause, And Response to Therapy \[SMART\]) have paired conjugated estrogen with an SERM, bazedoxifene (BZA), with the goal of achieving symptom and bone benefit without the need for adding progestational agent to HT regimen in women who have a uterus, while allowing synergy of both agents on certain end organs such as the bone.228 BZA belongs to the estrogen agonist-antagonist family of drugs. It has favorable effects on the bone and lipids but does not affect the endometrium or the breast.229,230 Treatment with BZA alone for 2 years had no effect on mammographic breast density.231 Furthermore, in the SMART-5 trial (using BZA paired with CEE), there was no increased incidence of breast density or tenderness when compared to CEE/MPA; existing data thus are reassuring regarding breast safety of combination of BZA and CEE.232

BZA combined with conjugated estrogens effectively suppresses hot flushes, improves vaginal atrophy, prevents bone loss, and does not stimulate the endometrium or cause breast tenderness.229,232-236 The combination of 20 mg BZA with CEE prevents endometrial hyperplasia and has an extremely high rate of amenorrhea (at least 80%).237,238 Given BZA’s antiestrogenic effects specific to the endometrium (even in the presence of CEE), the TSEC approach may be the future of HT, given that it maximizes the benefits of HT and also minimizes harm. It also allows for the avoidance of progestational agents. **The first TSEC to be approved by the FDA in the United States is Duavee**. This combination of BZA and estrogen may even be beneficial in special patient populations, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), where VMS may exacerbate MS symptoms. Preclinical data suggest a potential of BZA in facilitating myelin repair.239 A small sample RCT compared tolerability and effectiveness of Duavee versus placebo in 24 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women (mean age 51 ± 3.6 years) with MS. Reassuringly, there was no difference in MS-related relapses between Duavee versus placebo groups; symptom improvement was greater and sustained in the combination BZA+CEE

compared to placebo group, although this difference was not of statistical significance, most likely due to small sample size and short duration of intervention. At first diagnosis of MS, the preponderance of women is premenopausal; in recent decades, a shift in disease epidemiology has been observed with an increasing prevalence of MS in aging populations.240,241 Menopause transition and postmenopausal years may be particularly challenging, given the dual whammy of menopausal symptoms adding on to the burden of MS. The earlier-mentioned feasibility trial highlighted safety as well as a need for larger RCTs242 of HT in perimenopausal and menopausal women with MS.

### **TIBOLONE**

Tibolone is marketed for menopausal HT in many countries throughout the world but is not approved in the United States. Research on this product was initiated in the 1960s. Although tibolone was specifically developed as a drug to treat osteoporosis, the clinical performance of tibolone led rapidly to its approval for the treatment of menopausal symptoms as well as prevention of osteoporosis. Because of its unique metabolism to estrogen, progesterone, and androgens, tibolone can exert different hormonal activities at different sites. It has beneficial effects on bone density, improves VMS, and does not have estrogenic effects on the endometrium.243 Despite its many beneficial effects, however, there are concerns regarding its safety. Adverse effects of tibolone on breast tissue and increased stroke risk are described with its use, and overall, it is perceived to be less effective than estrogen-based HT.244 Given these concerns, we do not recommend it as a first-line management approach to menopause.

**The Chemistry of Tibolone**

Tibolone is structurally related to the 19-nortestosterone progestins that are used clinically in oral contraceptives; however, its activity depends on its metabolism. Tibolone (7-a,17-a-17-hydroxy-7-methyl-19-norpregn-5(10)-en-20-yn-3-one) is metabolized among human and nonhuman primates into three biologically active metabolites (**Figure 22.2**); the 3a-hydroxy (3a-

OH) metabolite and the 3β-hydroxy (3β-OH) metabolite have estrogen agonist properties, whereas the Δ-4 ketoisomer has progestogenic and androgenic effects.245,246 Although tibolone itself binds to the ER, in vivo the activity of 3-hydroxymetabolite’s estrogenic activity is 100 times greater, with a greater affinity for the ER-a than for ER-β.246 The loss of the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the A ring eliminates estrogenic activity in the Δ-4 isomer. The Δ-4 isomer exerts its androgenic effects primarily in the liver and brain.

The conversion of tibolone into metabolites (**Figure 22.2**) occurs chiefly in the liver and intestine. The metabolism of the parent compound is rapid and very near total, yielding mainly the 3a-OH and 3β-OH metabolites in the circulation; the level of the 3a-OH metabolite is 3-fold higher compared with the 3β-OH metabolite.247,248 Tibolone and the Δ-4 isomer can be detected only at peak levels 2 hours after ingestion, and, even then, the levels are very low, at the limit of detection. The half-life of the metabolites that predominate in the circulation (3a-OH and 3β-OH metabolites) is approximately 7 to 8 hours, and a steady state is attained by day 5\.249 Eating does not affect the metabolism, and tibolone can be taken at any time of the day.247 The pharmacokinetics of tibolone are not affected by impaired renal function. There is a very weak effect of the metabolites on cytochrome P450 enzymes, and no interference is to be expected with coadministered drugs.248 After the initial metabolism of tibolone, the products are rapidly sulfated, and more than 75% of the metabolites circulate as the sulfates to be activated by tissue sulfatases.248  
![][image9]

**FIGURE 22.2**

The metabolism of tibolone is not limited to the liver and intestine. Important effects are explained by specific local tissue metabolism. For example, the Δ-4 isomer is primarily produced within the endometrium, binds to the progesterone receptor (PR), and protects the endometrium from the agonist effects of the two estrogenic metabolites.248-253

Tibolone is available in two daily doses, 1.25 and 2.5 mg. There is considerable variability (\~30-40%) within and between subjects, but the 1.25- and 2.5-mg doses produce the same bioequivalence as measured by maximum levels and areas under the curve for the 3a-OH and 3β-OH metabolites.247 However, there are differences in clinical responses, which influence the choice of dose.

**Effect of Tibolone on Menopausal Symptoms**

Menopausal symptoms provide the main motivation for women to use postmenopausal HT. Tibolone must perform well in this category for it to be an attractive option for clinicians and patients. Clinical studies have

established that tibolone exerts an estrogenic beneficial impact on hot flushing and vaginal dryness. Appropriate studies have documented that tibolone in a daily dose of 2.5 mg is as effective as standard postmenopausal hormone regimens in treating hot flushing.254-260 The 1.25-mg dose takes longer to be effective, and this dose also has a higher incidence of persistent VMS.261 Fortunately, tibolone treatment provides an estrogenic effect on the vagina. Tibolone, 2.5 mg daily, relieves vaginal dryness and dyspareunia, and in most studies, tibolone is as effective as estrogen treatment.256-260,262-265 In addition, tibolone effectively treats the side effect of hot flushing associated with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy in premenopausal women.266

A decided advantage for tibolone over standard HT can be found in studies examining sexuality. In prospective, randomized trials comparing tibolone with estrogen or estrogen-progestin therapy, tibolone has been associated with a better sexual response.257,260,267-270 An increase in libido has been reported in studies comparing tibolone with placebo,265,271 and the response has been greater than that with ET, comparable to that associated with androgen treatment.272 The overall effect has included an increase in sexual interest and sexual performance, specifically fantasies, arousal, and orgasm.

There are two possible mechanisms for tibolone’s effect on sexuality: a direct androgenic effect of the Δ-4 isomer and/or an increase in the circulating level of free testosterone. Tibolone is associated with a profound change in the circulating levels of SHBG, about a 50% decrease.265,273 This is undoubtedly due to the Δ-4 isomer and an androgenic effect on the liver. Tibolone treatment, therefore, produces a decrease in the concentration of total testosterone (bound and unbound) but a substantial increase in the amount of free, unbound testosterone. This hormonal profile is a striking contrast to that associated with ET, which increases SHBG and decreases both total and free testosterone levels. The androgen side effects of acne and hirsutism, however, have not been reported with tibolone treatment.

When women who had been on tibolone for 10 years were compared with a matched group, the treated women were less clumsy, were less anxious in response to mild stress, and demonstrated better memory for facts, although there was no difference in memory for events and worse performance on sustained attention and planning.274 Overall, tibolone exerts

a positive effect on mood that is modest in impact.273,275 However, this is an area in which it is not easy to achieve consistent effects, a problem often due to the differences in measurement tools and definitions. The study of cognition is difficult because of the need to match treated and control groups for intelligence, age, occupation, education, and mental state (eg, depression). Because of this difficulty, the literature reporting the effects of HT on cognition provides an inconsistent picture. This is further complicated by the sensitivity and appropriateness of the assessment tools that are used. This is an area that requires standardization and new approaches for research, not only for tibolone but for all pharmacologic treatments that affect the central nervous system.

**Effect of Tibolone on the Cardiovascular System**

Consistent with reports of tibolone’s effects on HDL cholesterol in postmenopausal women, tibolone-treated monkeys have much lower HDL cholesterol compared with control monkeys.276 Although tibolone treatment resulted in lower circulating HDL cholesterol, coronary artery atherosclerosis extent in monkeys was not significantly different from the control group. Similar results were observed in the carotid arteries.277 That observation prompted the question of whether the HDL cholesterol reductions noted among the animals treated with tibolone were associated with physiologically meaningful reductions in HDL cholesterol function. HDL cholesterol has a critical role in reverse cholesterol transport, the mechanism by which cell cholesterol (ie, artery wall cholesterol) can be returned through the plasma to the liver for excretion.278 Further, it has been found that cholesterol efflux capacity predicts the severity and extent of coronary artery disease in human patients.279 Postmenopausal monkeys treated with tibolone had *no* reduction in cholesterol efflux.280 This disassociation between reductions in circulating concentrations of HDL cholesterol and the lack of change in HDL cholesterol function suggests the likelihood that this may account in large part for the finding that coronary artery atherosclerosis was not increased or decreased in the monkey model.

Short-term clinical studies uniformly document that tibolone treatment,

2.5 mg/d, reduces HDL cholesterol levels in women by about 20%; however, there is also a reduction in total cholesterol (about 10%) and

triglycerides (about 20%) and a slight decrease or no change in LDL cholesterol levels.268,276,281-286 In women, therefore, tibolone does not increase LDL cholesterol, and the reduction in HDL cholesterol is less than that recorded in monkeys. In addition, tibolone decreases LDL cholesterol oxidation and produces a shift away from the more atherogenic small dense LDL cholesterol, which would be beneficial.287 The potential harmful effects associated with reductions in HDL cholesterol are further balanced by tibolone-associated reductions in endothelin and lipoprotein(a), anti-ischemic effects detected in women with angina and an improvement in insulin sensitivity.286,288-291 In longer term studies, HDL cholesterol levels did not come back to baseline at the end of 2 years of treatment, but did return to baseline at the end of 3 years.286,292-294 Other studies have found that the decrease in HDL cholesterol is statistically insignificant.295,296

The recognition that reductions in HDL cholesterol are potentially harmful is based on the important roles for HDL cholesterol in the mediation of cholesterol movement from lipid-laden cells and inhibition of LDL cholesterol oxidation. However, the experimental results in the monkey model indicate that reductions in HDL cholesterol concentrations are not directly paralleled by reductions in important HDL cholesterol functions. At least one reason for this lack of direct correlation is the complex nature of HDL cholesterol lipoproteins, a heterogeneous collection of particles that differ in their activities.297 The overall change in HDL cholesterol levels will not reflect specific changes in particles that can affect specific biologic activities. Like results in the monkey model, a randomized trial in women demonstrated that significant reductions in HDL cholesterol levels (average 27%) caused by tibolone treatment, 2.5 mg/d, were due to a decrease in one subclass of HDL cholesterol particles, and measures of HDL cholesterol antiatherogenic functions (reverse cholesterol transport and inhibition of LDL cholesterol oxidation) were not impaired.291 The study was limited by the short, 12-week duration of treatment; however, the findings are consistent with those obtained in the 2-year monkey experiment. These human results were confirmed and strengthened by a study of 68 postmenopausal women randomized to daily treatment for 3 months with either 2.5-mg tibolone or placebo.298 Changes in HDL cholesterol were associated with an increase in hepatic lipase activity, an

androgenic effect, again without impairing the ability of plasma to maintain cholesterol efflux.

Results in the monkey model are consistent with an overall neutral impact on the cardiovascular system.277 A long-term (average of 7.5 years) follow-up of women treated with tibolone found no increase in carotid artery intimal-media thickness (cIMT) nor the number of atherosclerotic plaques, results that are consistent with the monkey model.299 This neutral impact is further supported by failing to find any effect of tibolone on experimentally induced brachial artery dilation or on vascular resistance measured in the carotid and middle cerebral arteries.295,300 On the other hand, a method studying venous dilation in the hand found an improvement in endothelium-dependent responses after tibolone treatment.301 Myocardial infarction and heart failure have been reported to be associated with overactivity of the sympathetic component of the cardiac autonomic nervous system, and tibolone treatment decreases plasma levels of free fatty acids, an effect that results in an improved ratio of cardiac sympathetic tone to parasympathetic tone, and a theoretical lowering of myocardial infarction and heart failure risk.302 Another favorable effect connected to tibolone and its metabolites is a direct impact on endothelial cells that results in a beneficial decrease in endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules, another human finding similar to that in the monkey trial.303

The OPAL (Osteoporosis Prevention and Arterial effects of tibolone) study was a 3-year, randomized, double-blind trial in six US centers and five European centers, treating 866 postmenopausal women with either daily 2.5-mg tibolone, 0.625/2.5 mg daily of conjugated estrogens/MPA, or placebo.304 The arterial end point of the study was cIMT measured by ultrasonography every 6 months. Both the tibolone-treated group and the estrogen/progestin-treated group demonstrated an increase in intima-media thickness at a rate significantly greater than the placebo group, leading to the conclusion that both tibolone and estrogen/progestin treatment increased atherosclerosis compared with the placebo group.

In the OPAL trial, European women differed from American women in multiple ways: higher lipids, higher blood pressure levels, and more smokers. Hysterectomized women were excluded in the United States, but not in Europe (28% of the study population). The overall mean results indicated  a  difference  comparing  both  treatment  groups  to  placebo.

However, the European women had improvement in atherosclerosis in the placebo group, making it easy to calculate a significant difference compared to the treated groups. In American women, there were no differences comparing the three treatment groups; all demonstrated progression of thickness. Thus, the overall conclusion was inordinately influenced by the results in the European women. The investigators could not explain these differences. Unfortunately, the OPAL trial did not achieve its goal of providing robust data on cardiovascular effects, due to the older age of the women and the notably different results in American and European women. There continues to be good reason to believe that tibolone has a neutral effect on the cardiovascular system. In addition, tibolone does not adversely affect the blood pressure in women with established hypertension.284

A case-control study assessed the risk of VTE in a very large population of postmenopausal women (23,505 cases and 231,562 controls) derived from the UK General Practice Research Database.305 No increase in risk was observed with the current use of either tibolone or transdermal estrogen compared with a significant increase associated with the current use of oral estrogen.

**Effect of Tibolone on Diabetes**

The administration of tibolone, 2.5 mg/d, to older women with type 2 diabetes mellitus produced no significant changes in the lipid profile.306 Tibolone treatment is associated with an increase in insulin sensitivity in women with insulin resistance, although some have reported no effect in normal women.283,291,307,308 Therefore, tibolone is an attractive option for postmenopausal women with diabetes mellitus.

**Effect of Tibolone on the Uterus**

Tibolone does not stimulate endometrial proliferation. This is because the predominant if not exclusive tibolone metabolite produced within the endometrium is the Δ-4 isomer, which binds to the PR and protects the endometrium from the agonist effects of the two estrogenic metabolites.250-

253 This protective effect has been documented in long-term (up to 8 years) human studies.252,253,256,263,264,309-311 Isolated cases of endometrial proliferation have been reported, for example, 4 of 150 women treated with 2.5 mg daily

for 2 years.312 In a 5-year follow-up, 47 of 434 women experienced bleeding, and of these, 11 had endometrial polyps or fibroids, but there were two with simple hyperplasia and two with endometrial carcinoma in situ.313 This underscores the standard clinical principle to investigate persistent vaginal bleeding in any postmenopausal woman. In the major US clinical trial, three cases of endometrial cancer were observed, but, in each case, preexisting carcinoma was later detected when the initial biopsy samples were more extensively examined.286 Nevertheless, a second large 2-year trial was conducted, the THEBES study, and no endometrial hyperplasia or cancer occurred in the tibolone-treated groups.314

The reported breakthrough bleeding rates with tibolone treatment have been comparable to treatment with combined, continuous estrogen-progestin therapy, but well-designed comparison clinical trials indicate that the rate is less with tibolone.257-260,265,282,309,315,316 In addition, amenorrhea is achieved more rapidly; 90% of tibolone-treated women are amenorrheic by 6 months.258,313,317 Bleeding is less in older women and can be greater with the 2.5-mg dose compared with the 1.25-mg dose, but the difference is too small to be detected in some studies.261,286,318 Importantly, a lack of correlation has been observed between bleeding and endometrial thickness measured by ultrasonography.318,319 **This again emphasizes the need to biopsy tibolone-treated women with persistent bleeding**.

Careful evaluations of women with fibroids who have been treated with tibolone have revealed no evidence of myoma growth, with up to 3 years of follow-up.320-322 Furthermore, add-back treatment with tibolone effectively prevents flushing and bone loss and does not impair the fibroid response to therapy with GnRH analogues.323

**Effect of Tibolone on the Breast**

The breast tissue, normal and abnormal, contains all the enzymes necessary for the formation of estrogens (sulfatase, aromatase, and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) and the conversion of estrogens into their sulfates (sulfotransferase) (**Figure 22.3**). Estrone sulfate concentrations are high in the breast (higher than in plasma) and even higher in cancer tissue. This state is achieved in postmenopausal women with very low systemic levels of estrogen, indicating that a local mechanism is operative.  
![][image10]

**FIGURE 22.3**

The major pathway of estrogen synthesis in human breast tumor cells is by conversion of estrone sulfate to estrone by estrone sulfatase, a pathway that is more important than the aromatase pathway.324 Aromatase is an enzyme complex that produces the irreversible conversion of androgens to estrogens. The location of aromatase activity is predominantly in the stromal tissue of the breast. Comparing normal to tumor tissue, the levels of estrone sulfate and estradiol were higher in the tumor tissue.325 Sulfatase activity is 130 to 200 times greater than aromatase activity in all breast tissues examined, and the sulfatase and aromatase activity was higher in the tumor tissue than in normal tissue. Thus, estrogen concentrations in the breast are elevated in women with breast cancer, and formation of estradiol from sulfated estrogen is the primary pathway. Most importantly, this increase in estrogen activity is independent of the ER status of the tissue.

Tibolone and its metabolites inhibit estrone sulfatase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase in normal stromal cells and in hormone-

dependent breast cancer cells (MCF-7 and T47D).326-329 This inhibits conversion of estrone sulfate to estradiol. In addition, tibolone and its 3-hydroxymetabolites increase the conversion of estrone back to estrone sulfate by increasing the activity of sulfotransferase.330 Tibolone and all three metabolites inhibit the conversion of estrone to estradiol by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.327 Although the combined effects resemble progestin activity, tibolone is more potent. Tibolone increases aromatase activity in stromal cells but only at high concentrations that are beyond in vivo levels.328 These tibolone-induced enzyme changes would lower the active estrogen concentrations in breast tissue.

In the rat and mouse breast cancer models (cancer induced by 7,12-dimethylbena\[a\]anthracene, DMBA), tibolone exerts protective effects to the same degree as tamoxifen.331 However, tibolone is not antiestrogenic and does not inhibit aromatase. Therefore, the mechanism is explained by the enzyme effects summarized previously, inhibition of sulfatase and 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and stimulation of sulfotransferase to increase the production of inactive sulfates.328 In addition, tibolone increases cellular differentiation and stimulates apoptosis, at least with normal breast cells in vitro.332 An increase in apoptosis is an action of the parent tibolone and its Δ-4 isomer. Thus, tibolone acts like progestins and weak androgens in breast cell line studies examining proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Tibolone and its metabolites do not display the same activity directed toward the sulfatase enzyme in all tissues. Strong inhibition of sulfatase is a major feature in breast cells, but tibolone and its metabolites inhibit sulfatase only moderately in the endometrium (still contributing to an antiestrogenic effect) and provide no inhibition of sulfatase in the bone (allowing a greater estrogenic impact).333

Postmenopausal HT increases breast density on mammography in about 10% to 20% of estrogen users and about 20% to 35% of estrogen-progestin users, an effect that occurs within the first months of treatment. In contrast, tibolone does not increase breast density and causes far less mastalgia than that seen with estrogen treatment.258,270,286,316,334-338 In addition, in women at high risk of breast cancer who underwent a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, treatment with either tibolone or traditional HT was still associated with a decrease in breast density. However, a greater decrease

was noted with tibolone.339 It is logical to conclude that these favorable responses are a consequence of the tibolone effects on the breast tissue enzymes involved in local estrogen production.

The Livial Intervention following Breast cancer: Efficacy, Recurrence, And Tolerability Endpoints (LIBERATE) trial was a multinational, placebo-controlled, randomized study of women with VMS who had had breast cancer surgically treated within the previous 5 years.340 The study was designed to demonstrate that 2.5-mg daily dose of tibolone was superior to placebo, but when the drug monitoring safety board notified the sponsor that there appeared to be an excess of breast cancers in the treated group, the trial was canceled on July 31, 2007, 5 months before its scheduled end. The median duration of participation and treatment was about 3 years, with a wide range from a few weeks to almost 5 years. The participants used a variety of adjuvant treatments for breast cancer, mostly tamoxifen, 66.8%, while 6.5% used AIs. Final numbers for analysis were 1,556 women in the treated group and 1,542 in the placebo group. The women aged under 40 to 79 years, with a mean age of 52.7 years. An estimated 57.8% had positive lymph nodes, and 70% had a tumor stage of IIA or higher. ER status was known in 2,808 women in whom the tumors were ER-positive in 77.8%. In the intent-to-treat analysis, the HR for recurrent breast cancer in the tibolone-treated women was 1.40 (CI \= 1.14-1.70). The absolute risk for tibolone was 51 cancers per 1,000 women per year and 36 in the placebo group. The increase occurred only in women with ER-positive tumors. There was no difference in mortality rates between the two groups during the 5-year study period. There were no differences in cardiovascular events or gynecologic cancers, while VMS, quality-of-life measures, and bone density all improved with tibolone treatment.

How do the LIBERATE results that indicate an estrogenic action of tibolone in breast cancer survivors jibe with the literature indicating that tibolone exerts a nonestrogenic effect on breast tissue? Indeed, it was realistic to expect tibolone to have a salutary effect on the breast. It is well documented that the breast responds to tibolone with less stimulation compared with estrogen, judged by changes in mammographic breast density and the characteristics of tissue obtained by fine-needle aspiration.
