Reproductive Aging, Nomenclature, Endocrinology, Symptomatology, and  
Implications

Throughout recorded history, multiple physical and mental conditions have been attributed to menopause. Although medical writers often wrote colorfully in the past, unfortunately they were also less than accurate, unencumbered by scientific information and data, and often approached reproductive aging and menopause as a “disorder” rather than as a normal phase along the continuum of aging. A good example of the stereotypical, inaccurate thinking promulgated over the years is the following statement, which dates back to 18871:

*The ovaries, after long years of service, have not the ability of retiring in graceful old age, but become irritated, transmit their irritation to the abdominal ganglia, which in turn transmit the irritation to the brain,*

*producing disturbances in the cerebral tissue exhibiting themselves in extreme nervousness or in an outburst of actual insanity*.

The belief that behavioral disturbances are related to manifestations of the female reproductive system is an ancient one that has persisted to contemporary times. Happenings such as aging-related illness or disability (or even death) in a spouse, relative, or friend; retirement from employment; financial insecurity; the need to provide care for very old parents and relatives; separation from children all likely underlie perceptions that associate the middle years of life with negative experiences, and problems arising from life events have often been erroneously attributed to the menopause.

The scientific study of all aspects of menstruation has been hampered by the overpowering influence of social and cultural beliefs and traditions. Problems arising from life events have often been erroneously attributed to menopause. Regrettably, not just societal perspectives, but also health care providers may be culpable in the perpetuation of this negative narrative of menopause, as only patients with bothersome symptoms come seeking help, with resulting sample bias adding to the distorted understanding of reality. However, robust data from reliable community-based longitudinal studies establish that the increase in most symptoms and problems in middle-aged women reflects social and personal circumstances, not the endocrine events of menopause.2-11 The variability in menopausal reactions makes the cross-sectional study design particularly unsuitable. Longitudinal studies are better for documenting what is normal and the variations around normal.

It is important to stress the normalcy of reproductive aging, with the final menstrual period (FMP) marking a physiologic watershed between reproductive and postreproductive phases of life. Longitudinal data have identified a relevance of societal, cultural, and personal perspectives for the severity of symptom burden that has long been attributable to reproductive aging in middle-aged women, and that the cessation of menses following menopause had almost no impact on subsequent physical and mental health.2-12 The Massachusetts Women’s Health Study, a large and comprehensive prospective, longitudinal study of middle-aged women, provides a powerful argument that the menopause is not and should not be viewed as a negative experience by the vast majority of women.3,12 The cessation of menses was perceived by these women (similarly to women in

other longitudinal studies) as having almost no impact on subsequent physical and mental health. This was reflected by women expressing either positive or neutral feelings about menopause. An exception was the group of women who experienced surgical menopause, but there is good reason to believe that the reasons for the surgical procedure were more important than the cessation of menses.

Changes in menstrual function are not symbols of some ominous “change.” There are good physiologic reasons for changing menstrual function, and understanding the physiology will do much to reinforce a healthy, normal attitude. Attitude and expectations about the menopause are very important. Women who have been frequent users of health services and who expect to have difficulty do experience greater symptoms and higher levels of depression.4,8,9 The symptoms that women report are related to many variables within their lives, and the hormonal change at menopause cannot be held responsible for the common psychosocial and lifestyle problems we all experience. It is important to stress the normalcy of this physiologic event. Menopause is not a disorder or a disease, and postmenopausal hormone therapy should be viewed as a specific strategy for management of symptoms in the short term for many, and as preventive pharmacology in the long term for some.

It can be further argued that physicians have had a biased (negative) point of view because the majority of women, being healthy and happy, do not seek contact with physicians.13,14 It is vital, therefore, that clinicians are not only familiar with the facts relative to the menopause but also have an appropriate attitude and philosophy regarding this period of life. Medical intervention at this point of life should be regarded as an opportunity to provide and reinforce a program of preventive health care. The issues of preventive health care for women are familiar ones. They include family planning, cessation of smoking, control of body weight and alcohol consumption, prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and osteoporosis, maintenance of mental well-being (including sexuality), cancer screening, and treatment of urologic problems.

### **GROWTH OF THE OLDER POPULATION**

We are experiencing a relatively new phenomenon: *we can expect to become old.* We are on the verge of becoming a rectangular society in which nearly all individuals survive to advanced age. In 1,000 BC, life expectancy was only 18 years. By 100 BC, the times of Julius Caesar, it had reached 25 years. In 1900, in the United States, life expectancy was only 49 years **(Figure 21.1)**. In 2005, the average life expectancy was 80.7 years for women and 75.4 for men.15 Today, once you reach age 65, you can expect to reach 83 if you are a man, and if you are a woman, age 85\.16 We can anticipate that eventually, about two-thirds of the population will survive to 85 or more and that more than 90% will live past age 65—this would be the nearly-perfect rectangular society **(Figure 21.2)**.17,18 Currently, Sweden and Switzerland are closest to this demographic composition.  
A good general definition of older adults is individuals aged 65 years and older, although it is not until age 75 that a significant proportion of individuals have an increase in health problems. Today, the older adult population is the largest contributor to illness and human need in the United

States. There are more old people (with their greater needs) than ever before.19 In 1900, there were approximately 3 million Americans aged 65 years and older (\~4% of the total population), and in 2000, there were 35 million (\~12% of the total population). By 2030, the older adult population in the United States will reach about 70 million, or about one in five Americans will then be aged 65 years or older.19 The world’s older adult population will become more than doubled from 1998 to 2025, rising from 264 million in 2009 to 416 million in 2050\.20 Population aging must be added to population growth as very important social problems.

**FIGURE 21.3**

Two modern phenomena have influenced the rate of change. The first was the post-World War II baby boom (1946-1964) that temporarily postponed the aging of the population, but that is now causing a faster aging of the general population. The second major influence has been the decline in old-age mortality. Our success in postponing death has increased the upper segment of the demographic contour **(Figure 21.3)**. By 2050, the current developed nations will be rectangular societies. China, by 2050, will contain more people over age 65 than the number of people of all ages currently living in the United States **(Table 21.1)**.

This paradigm shift in population demographics is a worldwide development and is not just limited to the affluent societies.21 The population of the earth will continue to grow until the year 2100 or 2150, when it is expected to stabilize at approximately 11 billion. After 2020, all of this growth will occur in developing countries.20 In 2000, the poorest countries (located in Africa and Asia) accounted for 87% of the world’s population. In 1950, only 40% of people 60 years and older lived in developing countries. By 2050, about 80% will live in those countries, as

fertility in the developing regions is expected to drop from 2.73 children per woman in 2005-2010 to 2.05 by 2050\.20

### **GENDER DIFFERENTIAL AND AGING**

In aging populations, a gender differential in survival is recognized. In 1900, men over age 65 in the United States outnumbered women by 102 to

100\. Now, there are only 70 men for every 100 women over age 65\.22 By age 85, only 39 men are alive for every 100 women. Nearly 90% of White American women can expect to live to age 70\. Vital statistics data indicate that this gender difference is similar in both Black and White populations in the United States **(Figure 21.4)**.23 Approximately 55% of girls, but only 35% of boys, live long enough to celebrate their 85th birthday.24 One in 5,600 individuals can expect to live to be 100, and women remain uniformly overrepresented in aged populations.22

**FIGURE 21.4**

**The 10 leading causes of death in the United States in 2016 were as follows**16**:**

1. **Heart disease**

2. **Cancer**

3. **Unintentional injuries**

4. **Chronic lower respiratory diseases**

5. **Stroke**

6. **Alzheimer disease**

7. **Diabetes mellitus**

8. **Influenza and pneumonia**

9. **Kidney diseases**

10. **Suicides**

Men and women reach old age with different prospects for older age, a sex differential that (it can be argued) is due in significant part to the sex-

hormone-induced differences in the cholesterol-lipoprotein profile and other cardiovascular factors and thus the greater incidence of atherosclerosis and earlier death in men. From a public health point of view, the greatest impact on the sex differential in mortality would be gained by concentrating on lifestyle changes designed to diminish atherosclerosis: low-cholesterol diet, no smoking, optimal body weight, and active exercise. The death rate is higher for men at all ages, and therefore women are overrepresented in aging populations **(Table 21.2)**. Coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for 40% of the mortality difference between men and women. Another one-third is from lung cancer, emphysema, cirrhosis, accidents, and suicides. It is interesting to note that in our society, the mortality difference between men and women is largely a difference in lifestyle. Smoking, drinking, coronary-prone behavior, and accidents account for most of the higher male mortality rate over age 65\. It has been estimated that perhaps two-thirds of the difference have been due to cigarettes alone. However, we should emphasize that this is due to a greater prevalence of smoking in men. Women whose smoking patterns are similar to those of men have a similar increased risk of morbidity and mortality.25

The mortality sex difference has been decreasing since 1979\. The U.S. Census Bureau projects that the difference in life expectancy between men and women will increase until the year 2050 and then level off. In 2050, life expectancy for women will be 82 years and for men, 76.7 years.26 There

will be 33.4 million women 65 years and older, compared with 22.1 million men.

### **CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS AND AGING**

In addition to the growing numbers of older adult people, the older population itself is getting older. For example, in 1984, the 65 to 74 age group in the United States was over 7 times larger than in 1900, but the 75 to 84 age group was 11 times larger, and the 85 and older group was 21 times larger. In the 1990s, the population 85 years and older increased by 38%.22 The most rapid increase is expected between 2010 and 2030 when the post-World War II baby boom generation will be aged 65 years and over. In the next century, the only age groups in the United States expected to experience significant growth will be those past age 55\. In this older age group, women will outnumber men by 2.6 to 1\. By the year 2040, in the United States, there will be 8 million to 13 million people 85 years of age or older; the estimate varies according to pessimistic to optimistic projections regarding disease prevention and treatment.

Societal norms relating to marriage, partnership, and cohabitation are evolving. Older women are more likely to be left unpartnered due to their male partners’ demise compared to older men (22%).27 Half of men 85 years and older live with their wives, but only 10% of older women live with their husbands.28 Because the unmarried tend to be more disadvantaged, there will be a need for more services for this segment of the older adult population. Older unmarried people are more vulnerable, demonstrating higher mortality rates and lower life satisfaction. Aging transgender females represent an expanding and uniquely disadvantaged population within aging communities.

**The Rectangularization of Life**

The lifespan is the biologic limit to life, the maximal obtainable age by a member of a species. The general impression is that the human lifespan is increasing. Actually, lifespan is fixed, and it is a biologic constant for each species.29 In fact, differences in species’ lifespans argue in favor of a

species-specific genetic basis for longevity. If lifespans were not fixed, it would mean an unlimited increase of our older adults. However, a correct analysis of survival reveals that death converges at the same maximal age; what has changed is life expectancy—the number of years of life expected from birth. Life expectancy cannot exceed the lifespan, but it can closely approximate it. Thus, as the number of older people who reach the maximum life expectancy increases, the percentage of a typical life spent in older years will increase **(Figure 21.2)**.

The industrialized world had almost eliminated premature death by reducing the burden of infectious diseases; disorders of the heart and the circulation, cancers, accidents, and suicides were leading causes of death until the world got ensnared in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, despite the havoc caused by the COVID-19 pandemic,30 the major determinant of life expectancy in the 21st century is chronic disease, affected by genetics, lifestyle, the environment, and aging itself. Even if cancer, diabetes, and all circulatory diseases were eliminated, life expectancy is unlikely to exceed 90 years.17

J.F. Fries described three eras in health and disease.31 The first era existed until sometime in the early 1900s and was characterized by acute infectious diseases. The second era, highlighted by CVD and cancer, is now beginning to fade into the third era, marked by problems of advancing age (fading eyesight and hearing, impaired memory and cognitive function, and decreased strength and reserve). Much of our medical approach is still based on the first era (find the disease and cure it), and we now have conditions that require a combination of medical, psychological, and social approaches. Our focus has been on age-dependent, fatal chronic diseases. The new challenge is with the nonfatal, age-dependent conditions, such as Alzheimer disease, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, obesity, and incontinence. It can be argued that health programs in the future should be evaluated by their impact on years free of disability, rather than on mortality.

**The Concept of the Compression of Morbidity**

Chronic illnesses are incremental in nature. The best health strategy is to change the slope, the rate at which illness develops, thus postponing the clinical illness and, if it is postponed long enough, effectively preventing it.

There has been a profound change in public consciousness toward disease. Disease is increasingly seen as something not necessarily best treated by medication or surgery but by prevention.

Preventing illness was expressed by J.F. Fries as the **compression of morbidity**.29,32 We would live relatively healthy lives and compress our illnesses into a short period of time just before death. Is this change really possible? A good affirmative example is the decrease in atherosclerosis in the United States. Reasons include changes in lifestyle (such as modifications in diet, minimizing the use of saturated fat, and increase in exercise), more effective detection and treatment of hypertension. Health benefits of smoking cessation represent another such example of successfully decreasing health burden through avoidance of toxic exposure **(Figure 21.5)**.

**FIGURE 21.5** After Fries JF, Crapo LM. *Vitality and Aging*. W.H. Freeman; 1981\.

**Tobacco continues to be the single most preventable cause of premature illness and death in the United States.** The use of chewing tobacco, pipe smoking, and cigars, and more recent trends of vaping all

contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality. Approximately 35% of people in the United States who have not obtained a high school diploma are smokers, but only 12% of those with higher education are smoking and only 5.7% of those with graduate degrees. Currently, approximately 17.5% of men and 13.5% of women are smokers.16 It is important to note that smoking has a greater adverse effect on women compared with men.33 Women who smoke only one to four cigarettes per day have a 2.5-fold increased risk of fatal CHD.34

Quitting smoking even after decades of smoking is still beneficial, and these effects can be apparent as early as 1 month after quitting.35 In the Nurses’ Health Study, 61% of the excess risk of CHD mortality and 42% of stroke mortality were eliminated within 5 years after quitting smoking.36 The improvement in respiratory disease mortality is slower, and a small increased risk of lung cancer mortality persists even after 30 years. However, by 20 years after cessation, all the excess risk of vascular mortality and death due to respiratory diseases other than lung cancer reached the level of a never smoker. Even older patients who already have coronary artery disease have improved survival if they quit smoking.37 No matter how old you are, if you continue to smoke, you have an increased relative risk of death. However, no matter how old you are, if you quit smoking, your risk of death decreases. Nevertheless, the risk of lung cancer remains elevated even in long-term ex-smokers.38

Since 1970, the death rate from CHD has declined approximately 50% in the United States. Between 1973 and 1987, in the United States, cardiovascular mortality declined in nearly every age group. In the combined age groups up to 54 years, cardiovascular mortality decreased to 42% and in people 55 to 84 years old, 33%.33 Despite our progress, we must continue to exert preventive efforts on the risk factors associated with CVD, especially obesity, hypertension, and lack of physical activity. The effort to improve the quality of life has an important value to society; it will decrease the average number of years that people are disabled, which is a major health and social problem of society. Most significantly, this is a major financial challenge for health care systems and social programs. With evolution toward a rectangular society, the ratio of beneficiaries to taxpayers grows rapidly, jeopardizing the financial support for health and

social programs. Compression of morbidity is at least one attractive solution to this problem.

### **MENOPAUSE AS AN OPPORTUNITY**

**Menopause is a normal phase of life, much like puberty**. For many women, the cessation of both menstruation and reproductive capacity is a welcome change—no further menses or premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and no need for contraception/concern for conceiving. Clinicians who interact with women at the time of menopause have a wonderful opportunity and, therefore, a significant obligation. Medical intervention at this point of life offers women years of benefit from preventive health care.

**While not underrating the importance of good health habits among the young, we would argue that the impact of teaching preventive care is more observable and more tangible at middle age. The prospects of limited mortality and the morbidity of chronic diseases are viewed with belief, understanding, and appreciation during these older years. The chance of illness is higher, but the impact of changes in lifestyle is greater.**

**Stages of Reproductive Aging—*From Reproductive Years to Perimenopause (Older Terminology) or Menopausal Transition (Newer Term) to Menopause***

In 2001, the Stages of Reproductive Aging Workshop (STRAW) standardized the nomenclature for the stages of the menopausal transition, categorizing the female lifespan into three broad phases: *reproductive* phase, *menopausal transition* phase, and *postmenopausal* phase*.* Each of the three phases is divided into stages based on clinical (menstrual cycle pattern and symptoms) and biochemical (serum levels of follicle stimulating hormone \[FSH\] and inhibin B) indices.39 In 2005, another classification system (PENN-5) was proposed based on analyses of the Penn Ovarian Aging Study. Investigators had noted significant changes in FSH and inhibin B levels in progression to the late premenopause stage that correlated with small alterations in the menstrual cycle and proposed

considering the late reproductive phase as a distinct entity.40,41 In 2010, at a follow-up workshop (“STRAW \+ 10”), the original STRAW classification was updated to reflect advances in our understanding of the changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian function occurring throughout the continuum of reproductive aging with incorporation of antimüllerian hormone (AMH) levels and ultrasound-based ovarian antral follicle count (AFC) data.42

The *menopausal transition* is a finite period of physiologic changes that eventually culminates in reproductive senescence. This phase of life can be associated with unique challenges that can have significant effects on individual women’s well-being and on quality of life.39 A woman is said to have reached *menopause* if she has remained amenorrheic for 12 consecutive months and demonstrates biochemical evidence of hypergonadotropic (elevated FSH and luteinizing hormone \[LH\] levels) hypogonadism (low estradiol levels). The FMP is identified as stage “0,” marking a watershed between reproductive and postreproductive periods of life. The *reproductive* phase itself is broken down into five stages (early \[−5\], peak \[−4\], and late \[−3\]). The *menopause transition* phase is broken down into two stages (early \[−2\] and late \[−1\]). The *postmenopause* phase is also divided into two stages (early \[+1\] and late \[+2\]).42 **The FMP thus serves as the reference point for interpretation of the rest of the stages across the three phases of reproductive aging (Figure 21.6)**.

***Late Reproductive Stage (STRAW Stage −3, Substages −3b, −3a)***

A decline in fecundability is apparent as the earliest hallmark of transition followed by a spectrum of clinically apparent phenomena, such as changes in menstrual cycle pattern. As covert endocrinologic changes set in well before noticeable and clinically apparent features (such as changes in the menstrual cycle length and/or pattern), STRAW \+10 divided the late reproductive stage into substages −3b and −3a that reflect the endocrinologic changes that are seen prior to overt clinical manifestations. In stage −3b, the menstrual cycles are relatively unchanged; while serum levels of FSH are in the premenopausal range, levels of AMH and inhibin B are low, as is the AFC.42 In stage −3a, shortening in the length of menstrual cycles and increases in early follicular FSH levels become noticeable.42  
![][image4]

**FIGURE 21.6** Adapted and modified from Harlow SD, Gass M, Hall JE, et al; STRAW \+ 10 Collaborative Group. Executive summary of the stages of reproductive aging workshop \+ 10: addressing the unfinished agenda of staging reproductive aging. *Climacteric*. 2012;15(2):105-114.

***Early Menopausal Transition (STRAW Stage −2)***

This stage is characterized by increasing irregularity of the menstrual cycle length. This irregularity is defined as a recurrence of 7-day difference in cycle length over 10 cycles. This stage is also characterized by variable elevations in early follicular phase FSH levels, with persistently low AMH levels and low AFC.42

***Late Menopausal Transition (STRAW Stage −1)***

The late menopausal transition is characterized by missed menses with periods of amenorrhea lasting at least 60 days. This degree of irregularity in menstrual cycles is due to variability in reproductive hormonal levels and a high incidence of anovulatory cycles. FSH levels are elevated, often to above 25 IU/L. In contrast, AMH and inhibin B levels are often undetectable. Serum levels of LH may still be in the normal premenopausal range. Estradiol levels can vary from low to even high.43-49 The persistent hypoestrogenemia that is an endocrinologic hallmark of menopause may not be reached until late in this stage prior to the FMP **(Figure 21.7)**. An exaggerated response of the residual ovarian follicles to elevated circulating levels of FSH, and thereby multifollicular recruitment and growth, are mechanisms to explain elevations in estradiol that may be inconsistently

noticeable. The persistent hypoestrogenemia, one of the endocrinologic hallmarks of the menopausal state, may not be reached until late in this stage. This stage can last 1 to 3 years and is when the vasomotor symptoms (VMS), such as hot flushes and night sweats, often begin to occur.42

***Early Postmenopause (STRAW Stage 1, Substages \+1a, \+1b, \+1c)***

In early postmenopause, FSH levels continue to rise, while estradiol levels decline until 2 years after the FMP, after which these hormone levels stabilize. The substages \+1a and \+1b in early menopause last 1 year each and culminate once fluctuations in FSH levels stabilize. **Stage** \+**1a marks the completion of the 12-month interval required to define the FMP**. This substage also marks the end of the *perimenopause* (ie, the time near menopause, which starts at stage −2 and ends 12 at months following the FMP).42 Blood levels of FSH and estradiol can continue to fluctuate somewhat during stage \+1b. VMS are most common in stages \+1a and \+1b. It is in stage \+1c that the elevated FSH and low estradiol levels become the new normal. This substage can last for up to 3 to 6 years. As such, the entire early postmenopause stage spans a total of 5 to 8 years.42

***Late Postmenopause (Stage \+2)***

During this stage, reproductive hormone levels are essentially plateaued and stable. While the burden of VMS eases off for many, physical symptoms attributable to lack of estrogen, such as vaginal dryness and urogenital symptoms, become more prominent at and with progression into this stage. Interestingly, FSH levels may actually decline further with advancing age, although more research is needed to confirm this observation.42

### **THE MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION**

There is only one marker, menstrual irregularity, that can be used to objectively define and establish what is called the menopausal transition. This irregularity will be perceived by patients as skipped menstrual periods or longer durations (\~40-60 days) between periods.50 There is no universal pattern; each woman will perceive a change that is her own individual characteristic alteration.  
![][image5]

**FIGURE 21.7**

M**enopause** is that point in time when permanent cessation of menstruation occurs following the loss of ovarian activity. Menopause is derived from the Greek words *men* (month) and *pausis* (cessation). **Climacteric**, an older, more general, and less precise term, indicates the period of time when a woman passes from the reproductive stage of life through the menopausal transition and the menopause to the postmenopausal years. Climacteric is from the Greek word for ladder. **Perimenopause** is the newer term that includes the years prior to the FMP during which menstrual cycles progress from a regular ovulatory and predictable pattern to irregular and increasingly anovulatory cycles to eventual cessation of menses.42

Menstrual cycle length is determined by the rate and quality of follicular growth and development. It is normal for the cycle to vary in individual women. Informative data come from two seminal longitudinal studies (with very similar results): the study of Vollman of more than 30,000 cycles

recorded by 650 women and the study of Treloar of more than 25,000 woman-years in a little over 2,700 women.51,52 The earlier observations of Vollman and Treloar that documented a normal evolution in length and variation in menstrual cycles were subsequently confirmed by Cole et al53 **(Figure 21.7)**.

Following the onset of menarche, there is an approximately 2- to 3-year period of relatively longer menstrual cycles at first, after which there is increasing regularity as cycles shorten to reach the usual reproductive age pattern. In the 40s, cycle length may begin to alter again. The highest incidence of anovulatory cycles is under age 20 and over age 40\.54,55 By age 25, over 40% of cycles are between 25 and 28 days in length; from 25 to 35 years, over 60% are between 25 and 28 days. Although a 28-day cycle length is deemed as the standard for normal, overall, only approximately 15% of reproductive age cycles are 28 days in length. Only 0.5% of women experience a cycle less than 21-days long and only 0.9% a cycle greater than 35 days.56 Most women have cycles that last from 24 to 35 days, but at least 20% of women experience irregular cycles.57 When women are in their 40s, anovulation becomes more prevalent, and menstrual cycle length increases, beginning 2 to 8 years before menopause.52 Follicular phase and overall cycle length reach their nadir at approximately age 42\. Over the subsequent 8 to 10 years preceding the FMP, average cycle length and variability steadily increase as ovulations become less frequent.51 Cycles greater than 40 days in length are quite prevalent in the year before menopause and anything exceeding 42 days in length is suggestive of impending FMP within the next 1 to 2 years.58,59 This period of longer cycles commonly precedes menopause no matter at what age menses cease, whether menopause is early or late.60 However, the prognostic time frame for FMP may be influenced by factors such as tobacco use, ethnicity (increased time frame in Black women), a history of longer cycles, as well as age at the onset of menopausal transition.61,62 *The duration of the follicular phase is the major determinant of cycle length*.63,43 This period of menstrual cycle change prior to FMP is marked by elevated FSH levels and decreased levels of inhibin but normal levels of LH and slightly elevated levels of estradiol.44-49,64 **Importantly, up to 25% of irregular cycles with intervals of over 50 to 60 days can still be ovulatory, and late perimenopausal  women  therefore  remain  at  risk  for  unplanned**

**pregnancy despite low fecundability.**65 **Late perimenopausal women remain at risk for unplanned pregnancy.** According to the *Guinness Book of World Records*, a woman from the United Kingdom holds the modern record for the oldest spontaneous pregnancy, conceiving at 59\.66,67

**In the average woman, a decline in fertility begins around ages 37 and 38, and menopause follows approximately 13 years later (average age 51).** However, in epidemiologic studies, approximately 10% of women in the general population become menopausal by the age of 45 years.65,66 While the exact mechanisms underlying spontaneous early menopause (before age 45\) remain unclear, and are not generalizable, it is probable that some women are born with a smaller than normal ovarian follicular pool that gets functionally depleted at an earlier age. Menopause occurs when the number of remaining ovarian follicles falls below a critical threshold, about 1,000, regardless of age.

**Contrary to older belief (based on a seminal report by Sherman et al in 1976),**61 **estradiol levels do not gradually wane in the years before menopause, but remain in the normal range, and can even be slightly elevated, until about 1 year before follicular growth and development cease.** Sherman et al conducted a small cross-sectional study wherein serum samples were collected over a single menstrual cycle from eight women, aged 46 to 56 years, for the study of reproductive hormones. More recent longitudinal studies of women as they pass through the menopausal transition reveal that estrogen levels do not begin a major decline until about a year before menopause **(Figure 21.8)**.47,68,69 Indeed, women experiencing the menopausal transition actually have higher overall estrogen levels, a response that is logically explained by an increased ovarian follicular reaction in response to the higher circulating FSH levels during this period.70 Variability in estrogen levels is characteristic of the menopausal transition, with greater hormonal variability observed in menstrual cycles that display greater irregularity.71
