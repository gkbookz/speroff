As noted, most women experience a 2- to 8-year period of time prior to the FMP when the occurrence of anovulation becomes common.52 During this time, ovarian follicles continue their rate of loss until the reservoir is finally depleted.72,73 In a study of human ovaries, the loss that began when the total number of follicles reached approximately 25,000, usually at ages 37 and 38, correlated with a subtle but real increase in FSH and a decrease

in inhibin levels.74 These changes begin around age 35 but accelerate after 40 and parallel the decline in fecundity that occurs with aging. Aging-related decline in the *quantity* of ovarian follicles is directly related to the rise in FSH levels that occurs with advancing age; this rise in FSH results from reduced secretion of inhibin, a granulosa cell product that exerts important negative feedback on FSH secretion by the pituitary gland. It is possible that both inhibin A and inhibin B may be involved, because luteal phase levels of inhibin A and follicular phase levels of inhibin B decrease with aging and predate the rise in FSH.75-77 A careful study in Australia, however, indicated that the increase in FSH was correlated only with a decrease in inhibin B, and in response to elevated FSH, estradiol levels increased slightly.68

**FIGURE 21.8**

A decrease in inhibin production by the follicular granulosa cells could reflect a shrinking number of ovarian follicles or a reduced functional capacity of the older follicles or both.78 **The observation that preovulatory follicular fluid inhibin concentrations are similar in young and older cycling women suggests that the number of remaining follicles is the most important factor.**79 In the late reproductive stage, driven by higher FSH levels, the process of follicular recruitment and development gets accelerated with resulting shortening of the follicular phase. This accelerated pace of follicular development in the late reproductive stage is reflected in higher estradiol levels being attained earlier in the follicular phase.80 **Careful studies indicated that the earlier acute rise in estradiol levels results from advanced follicular development at the beginning of the cycle and earlier selection of the dominant follicle.** A rise in estradiol levels earlier in the follicular phase is a recognized hallmark of decreased ovarian reserve. With declining inhibin levels with advancing age, FSH levels start to rise in the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This early rise in FSH initiates early follicular recruitment, accelerates follicular development and earlier selection of a dominant follicle in the succeeding cycle with resulting shortening of the follicular phase and of cycle length.81,82 Follicular phase and overall cycle length reach their nadir at approximately age 42\. Over the subsequent 8 to 10 years preceding the FMP, average cycle length and variability steadily increase as ovulations become less regular and less frequent.51 The aging-related changes in the endocrine characteristics of the menstrual cycle that result from progressive follicular depletion correlate with a measurable decrease in the ovarian volume and in the number of antral follicles observed by transvaginal ultrasonography during the early follicular phase.83-89

The inverse and tight relationship between FSH and inhibin indicates that inhibin is a sensitive marker of ovarian follicular competence and, in turn, that FSH measurement is a reflection of inhibin action.44,45 The decrease in inhibin secretion by the ovarian follicles begins early (around age 35), but accelerates after age 40, and parallels the decline in fecundity that occurs with aging (as discussed in Chapter 28). **Furthermore, the ineffective ability to achieve suppression of gonadotropins with menopausal hormone therapy is a consequence of the loss of inhibin,**

**and for this reason, FSH levels cannot be used to titrate estrogen dosage in menopausal women on standard hormone therapy regimens.**

The Michigan Bone Health and Metabolism Study is a longitudinal assessment of the menopausal transition in a cohort of 629 women, initiated in 1992 to 1993\. The initial rise in FSH in these women was modest until 7 years prior to menopause but accelerated with an even greater increase in the 2 years before menopause, finally reaching a plateau about a year after menopause.90 The major decrease in estradiol levels began about 2 years before menopause.91 Declining levels of inhibin B and AMH reached a low to nondetectable point about 5 years before menopause.92 Although the inhibin B and AMH results are in agreement with other reports, an exactness of the timing is limited by the fact that the blood samples were obtained from only 50 women in the study. Furthermore, Depmann et al also demonstrated that while AMH can help in predicting impending menopause as it relates to aging, this predictability is far from robust.93 Nevertheless, the Michigan study confirms the validity of AMH as a marker for residual ovarian follicles, a concept that is referred to as *ovarian reserve*. Unlike inhibin B, AMH is not a participant in the feedback relationship between the ovary and the pituitary gonadotropins; rather, AMH, a product of the granulosa cells, reflects the number of residual follicles awaiting FSH stimulation.94 **The variability in these hormone measurements from individual to individual, however, precludes the practical use of these biomarkers to predict with accuracy the future date of menopause.**93

During the transition or perimenopausal years, circulating FSH may reach postmenopausal levels (\>20 IU/L) despite ongoing menstrual cycles; LH levels, however, still remain in the normal premenopausal range. The frequency of anovulatory cycles increases, although occasionally, corpus luteum formation and function occur; the perimenopausal woman is thus not safely beyond the risk of an unplanned and unexpected pregnancy until persistently elevated levels of both FSH (25 IU/L) and LH (30 IU/L) can be demonstrated.46 However, even under these circumstances, fluctuations can occur, with a transient period of ovarian failure (reflected in amenorrhea, elevated gonadotropins, and low estradiol levels), followed by spontaneous resumption of ovarian function for brief periods.45 **Because variability is the rule, it would be wise to recommend the use of contraception until**

**the postmenopausal stage is definitely established. Several months of amenorrhea together with a persistently elevated FSH level of 40 IU/L or more are reliable signals that menopause is either near or has already happened.**95

In the longitudinal Massachusetts Women’s Health Study, women who reported the onset of menstrual irregularity were considered to be in the perimenopausal period of life.96 The median age for the onset of this period was 47.5 years. **Only 10% of women ceased menstruating abruptly, with no period of prolonged irregularity.** The menopausal transition from reproductive to postreproductive status was, for most women, approximately 4 years in duration. In the study by Treloar, the average age for entry into the menopausal transition was 45.1, and the age range that included 95% of the women was 39 to 51\.65 The mean duration of the menopausal transition was 5.0 years, with a range of 2 to 8 years **(Table 21.3)**.

**Timing of Natural Menopause**

Designating the average age of menopause has been somewhat difficult. Based on cross-sectional studies, the median age was estimated to be somewhere between 50 and 52\.97 These studies relied on retrospective memories and the subjective vagaries of the individual being interviewed. Until recently, studies with longitudinal follow-up to observe women and record their experiences as they pass through menopause were hampered by relatively small numbers. The Massachusetts Women’s Health Study provides us with data from 2,570 women.96

The median age for menopause in the Massachusetts Study was 51.3 years. Only current smoking could be identified as a cause of earlier menopause, a shift of approximately 1.5 years. Those factors that did not affect the age of menopause in this study included the use of oral contraception, socioeconomic status, and marital status. Keep in mind that a **median** age of menopause means that only half the women have reached menopause at this age. In the classic longitudinal study by Treloar, the **average** age of menopause was 50.7 years, and the range that included 95% of the women was 44 to 56 years.98 In a survey in the Netherlands, the

average age of menopause was 50.2, and in an Italian longitudinal study, it was 50.9 years.66,99

The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN) is an ongoing, national study, recording the health of American women of diverse backgrounds as they pass through the perimenopausal transition ([http://www.edc.gsph.pitt.edu/swan/](http://www.edc.gsph.pitt.edu/swan/)). The study began in 1994 in seven research centers and enrolled 3,302 participants with five racial/ethnic groups and a variety of backgrounds for an initial cross-sectional survey. In 1996, these women began a longitudinal, follow-up study with extensive data collection occurring annually.

In the SWAN study, the median age of menopause was 51.4, with an earlier onset associated with current smoking, lower education, and lower socioeconomic status, whereas a later age was associated with parity and prior use of oral contraceptives.100 In contrast, a Dutch study concluded that prior use of oral contraceptives was associated with earlier (\<1 year) menopause.101 About 1% of women have been reported to experience menopause before the age of 40\.102 The SWAN study reported a similar percentage of 1.1%, with a slightly higher rate in Black and Hispanic women and a lower rate of 0.5% in Chinese women and 0.1% in Japanese women.103 Hispanic women experienced menopause about 6 months earlier compared with other ethnic groups, whereas Japanese women were about 3 months later.

Two large cohorts of European women reported average ages of menopause in various countries that centered around age 51 years, slightly higher in Northern Europe and slightly lower in Southern Europe.104 Some countries, like India, report an average age of menopause as much as 5 years earlier.105 In epidemiologic studies, approximately 10% of women in the general population become menopausal by the age of 45 years.65,66 Pedigree analysis has revealed that the genetic features of early menopause (age 40-45) and premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) or failure (cessation of ovarian function occurring at an age \<40) are similar and suggest a dominant pattern of inheritance through maternal or paternal relatives.106,107 There are two studies indicating that daughters of mothers with an early menopause (before age 46\) also have an early menopause, with up to 15% of women having a first-degree relative with early menopause.108-111

There is sufficient evidence to suggest that chronically undernourished women and vegetarians may experience an earlier menopause.108,112 Because of the contribution of body fat to estrogen production, thinner women experience a slightly earlier menopause.113 Frequent consumption of alcohol is associated with a later menopause.109 This is consistent with the reports that women who consume alcohol have higher blood and urinary levels of estrogen.114-118

In multiple studies, there has been no correlation between age of menarche and age of menopause, with the exception of one Swedish study concluding that an earlier menarche and earlier menopause go together.66,98,108,119,120 In most studies, race, parity, and height have no influence on the age of menopause; however, three cross-sectional studies found later menopause to be associated with increasing parity.66,96,100,108,113 Two studies found that irregular menses among women in their early 40s predict an earlier menopause.121,122 A French survey detected no influence of heavy physical work on early menopause (before age 45).123 An earlier menopause has been reported to be associated with living at high altitudes.124,125 In addition, most intriguingly, an earlier age of menopause has been reported in left-handed women compared with right-handed women.126,127 Finally, intrauterine growth restriction in late gestation may predispose the affected female progeny to earlier menopause.128

It has been suggested, albeit inconsistently, that time to FMP may get accelerated in women undergoing pelvic surgery, wherein ovarian vascular

supply may get compromised, such as following an abdominal hysterectomy. Effects of pelvic surgery on biomarkers of ovarian reserve have been examined, with mixed results. A prospective study could find no elevations of FSH within the first 2 years after surgery.129-131 Furthermore, in a cross-sectional study assessing ovarian reserve following ovarian cystectomy (for cysts other than endometriomas) and, or salpingectomy, there was no appreciable effect on ovarian reserve.132

Multiple studies have consistently documented that an earlier menopause (an average of 1.5 years earlier) is a consequence of smoking. There is a dose-response relationship with the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking.133,134 Even former smokers show evidence of an impact.104

Unlike the decline in age of menarche that occurred with an improvement in health and living conditions, most historical investigation indicates that the age of menopause has changed little since early Greek times.135,136 Others (a minority) have disagreed, concluding that the age of menopause did undergo a change, starting with an average age of about 40 years in ancient times, and in Sweden, an increase of about 1 year over a span of 80 years.120,137 If there has been a change, however, history indicates that it has been minimal. Even in ancient writings, 50 years is not uncommonly cited as the age of menopause.

**Sexuality, Aging, and Menopause**

Sexuality is behavior that evolves and chances across the lifespan. It begins with birth (maybe before) and ends with death. The notion that sexuality ends with aging is inherently illogical. The need for closeness, caring, and companionship is lifelong. Old people today live longer, are healthier, have more education and leisure time, and have had their consciousness raised in regard to sexuality.

Younger people, especially physicians, underrate the extent of sexual interest in older people. In a random sample of women aged 50 to 82 years in Madison, Wisconsin, nearly one-half of the women reported an ongoing sexual relationship.138 In the Duke longitudinal study on aging, 70% of men in the 67 to 77 age group were sexually active, and 80% reported continuing sexual interest, while 50% of all older women were still

interested in sex.139 In the Postmenopausal Estrogen/Progestin Interventions (PEPI) trial, 60% of women 55 to 64 years old were sexually active.140 In a national sample of American men and women, the prevalence of sexual behavior declined with aging; however, 26% of individuals aged 75 to 85 years were still sexually active.141 The prevalence of self-reported sexual problems peaks in middle-aged women, sufficient to cause distress in about 22% of US women and about 12% of women aged 45 to 64\.142 Up to 23% of menopausal women are negatively affected by decreased sexual desire.143 The decline in sexual activity with aging is influenced by culture and attitudes, as well as by nature and physiology (or hormones). As estradiol regulates serotonergic function, it can affect desire and sexual function.143 In addition, the discomfort resulting from vaginal dryness and tissue atrophy consequent to low estradiol levels can make coitus unwelcome, even to the point of avoidance. Thus, a significant component of decline in sexual activity in reproductively aging women can be attributed to menopausal symptoms associated with decreasing estrogen levels, a problem that is

easily ameliorated by targeted treatment.

There are two main sexual changes in the aging woman. There is a reduction in the rate of production and volume of vaginal lubricating fluid, and there is some loss of vaginal elasticity and thickness of the epithelium. Less vaginal atrophy is noted in sexually active women than in inactive women; presumably, the activity maintains vaginal vasculature and circulation. The spectrum of uncomfortable symptoms that are often described by transitioning and menopausal women with evidence of genital atrophy include a feeling of dryness and tightness, vaginal irritation and burning with penetration, and postcoital spotting and soreness. Given that these symptoms are the direct result of tissue estrogen deprivation, the underlying tissue changes can be effectively prevented by focal estrogen treatment. Systemic estrogen therapy may even have a positive impact on sexuality beyond effects on vaginal tissue.140 In an ancillary sexual study of the Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study (KEEPS)—a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial—early menopausal women were randomized to receive either low-dose oral conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) or transdermal estradiol (transdermal E2), over the 4 years of intervention. While both routes of estrogen treatment resulted in an improvement in vaginal dryness and dyspareunia,143 improvements in libido

and sexual satisfaction were observed only in transdermal E2 users.143 In an Australian study assessing changes in sexual functioning during the menopausal transition, a correlation with a decline in sexuality was demonstrated with estradiol levels but not with testosterone levels. There are likely many important factors other than hormone levels that are relevant in determining midlife sexual function.143,144

***Illness and Sex***

It is not uncommon to encounter medical or surgical underpinnings to disorders of sexuality. Surgical menopause (removal of both ovaries in premenopausal women) is probably one of the most commonly encountered iatrogenic contributors to altered sexual function in reproductive age women. Remember that vaginal lubrication is an important physiologic sexual response, and, therefore, vaginal dryness is a likely consequence following total hysterectomy even if the premenopausal ovaries are retained. Sexual problems are not limited, however, to surgical procedures and illnesses of the genitalia. Altered self-image such as following vulvectomy or mastectomy can also impact sexual function. However, studies have not found postmenopausal hysterectomy to have a detrimental impact on sexuality.140,145

Sexual counseling, to be effective, must be provided to couples both before and after surgery. It is not unexpected that the surgeon may not be fully capable of providing this counseling. A major contribution from an older woman’s primary clinician is to arrange for competent and experienced sexual counseling. Unfortunately, most physicians operate on the principle that if no questions are raised, there is no problem. The expert surgeon should be grateful for the help of experts in psychosexual therapy. Seek out the potential for posttreatment sexual morbidity before the surgery. Assess the patient’s abilities for coping and her sense of body image. Consider the quality of the patient’s relationship, and be sensitive to the absence of a relationship. This entire effort may take some time. The normal state of presurgical anxiety, fear, and denial hampers good communication.

Increasing use of SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) antidepressants is another iatrogenic contributor to female sexual dysfunction that merits attention.146

Antihypertensive agents are frequently responsible for male sexual dysfunction, but little information is available regarding female sexual function. Adrenergic blocking agents are especially noted to affect libido and potency in men. Similarly, psychotropic drugs of all categories have been associated with inhibition of sexual function. Finally, one should always suspect alcoholism when patients complain of sexual dysfunction. Androgen treatment for decreased female sexuality is discussed later in this chapter.

The two most important influences on sexual satisfaction in aging couples are the strength of relationship and the physical condition of each partner.140,141,147 The single most significant determinant of sexual activity for older women is the lack of availability of partners due to divorce or demise as women are outliving men. Given availability of a partner, the same general high or low rate of sexual activity can be maintained throughout life.4,148 Longitudinal studies indicate that the level of sexual activity is more stable over time than previously suggested.149-151 Individuals who are sexually active earlier in life continue to be so into old age. However, aging is associated with a decline in sexual function in many women, and this decline has been documented in the years well before the FMP.152,153

### **HORMONE PROFILE OF MENOPAUSAL TRANSITION AND POSTMENOPAUSE**

Shortly after menopause, one can safely say that there are no remaining ovarian follicles.69,154 Eventually, there is a 10 to 20-fold increase in FSH and an approximately 3-fold increase in LH, reaching a maximal level 1 to 3 years after menopause, after which there is a gradual, but slight, decline in both gonadotropins.155,156 Elevated levels of both FSH and LH at this time in life are conclusive evidence of ovarian failure. FSH levels are higher than LH because LH is cleared from the blood so much faster (initial half-lives are \~20 minutes for LH and 3-4 hours for FSH) and perhaps because there is no specific negative feedback peptide for LH like inhibin. An aging-related decline in the gonadotropin levels in the latter years of postmenopausal life is well described and is believed to reflect aging of the

pituitary gonadotropin-secreting cells, specifically a decrease in the ability to respond to the hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

The postmenopausal ovary continues to secrete androgens, primarily androstenedione and testosterone. However, the circulating level of androstenedione after menopause is about one-half that seen prior to menopause.157 Most of this postmenopausal androstenedione is derived from the adrenal gland, with only a small amount secreted from the ovary, even though androstenedione is the principal steroid secreted by the postmenopausal ovary.158,159 Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate (DHEA-S), originating in the adrenal gland, decline markedly with aging; in the decade after menopause, the circulating levels of DHEA are approximately 70% less, and levels of DHEA-S are about 74% less than the levels in young adult life.160,161

Testosterone production decreases by approximately 25% after menopause, compared to the case in the premenopausal period. The postmenopausal ovary in most, but not all, women secretes more testosterone than the premenopausal ovary, at least in the initial years of the postmenopausal period. With the disappearance of follicles and estrogen, the elevated gonadotropins drive the remaining tissue in the ovary to a level of increased testosterone secretion. The ovarian cells of origin are uncertain; presumably, the steroidogenic tissue is that which has accumulated from ovarian follicles undergoing atresia because stromal cells believed to be of mesenchymal origin lack steroidogenic capability.162 Suppression of gonadotropins with GnRH agonist or antagonist treatment of postmenopausal women results in a significant decrease in circulating levels of testosterone, indicating a gonadotropin-dependent ovarian origin to circulating testosterone in postmenopausal women.163-165

The total amount of testosterone produced after menopause, however, is decreased because the amount of the primary source, peripheral conversion of androstenedione, is reduced. The early postmenopausal circulating level of androstenedione decreases approximately 62% from young adult life.160 **The menopausal decline in the circulating levels of testosterone is not great, from no change in many women to as much as 15% in others**.47,156,160,166,167  
In an excellent longitudinal Australian study spanning a period from 5

years before to 7 years after menopause onset, the circulating levels of

testosterone did not change.161 Indeed, because of a decrease in sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), this Australian study identified an increase in free androgens postmenopause**. Late postmenopause may be considered as a state of relative androgen excess.**

Later in the postmenopausal years, the circulating androgen levels are nearly all, if not all, derived from the adrenal gland. A careful study could detect no circulating androgens in postmenopausal women (averaging 12 years distant from menopause onset) with complete adrenal insufficiency and no intraovarian testosterone or androstenedione.168

The circulating estradiol level after menopause is approximately 10 to 20 pg/mL, most of which is derived from peripheral conversion of estrone, which in turn is mainly derived from the peripheral conversion of androstenedione.157,169,170 The circulating level of estrone in postmenopausal women is higher than that of estradiol, approximately 30 to 70 pg/mL **(Table 21.4)**. The average postmenopausal production rate of estrogen is approximately 45 μg/24 hours, almost all, if not all, being estrogen derived from the peripheral conversion of androgens. The androgen-estrogen ratio changes drastically after menopause because of the more marked decline in estrogen, and an onset of mild hirsutism is common, reflecting this marked shift in the sex hormone ratio. With increasing postmenopausal age, a decrease can be measured in the circulating levels of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and DHEA, whereas the circulating postmenopausal levels of androstenedione, testosterone, and estrogen remain relatively constant.156,157

Estrogen production by the ovaries does not continue beyond the menopause; however, estrogen levels in postmenopausal women can be significant, principally due to the extra glandular conversion of androstenedione and testosterone to estrogen. The clinical impact of this estrogen varies from one postmenopausal woman to another, depending on the degree of extra glandular production, modified by a variety of factors.

The percent conversion of androstenedione to estrogen correlates with body weight. Increased production of estrogen from androstenedione with increasing body weight is probably due to the ability of fat to aromatize androgens. This fact and a decrease in the levels of SHBG (which results in increased free estrogen concentrations) contribute to the well-recognized association between obesity and the development of endometrial cancer.

Body weight, therefore, has a positive correlation with the circulating levels of estrone and estradiol.157 Aromatization of androgens to estrogens is not limited to adipose tissue, however, because almost every tissue tested has this activity.

|  | *Reproductive Age* | *Postmenopausal* | *Oophorectomized* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Androstenedione | 2-3 mg/d | 0.5-1.5 mg/d | 0.4-1.2 mg/d |
| Dehydroepiandrosterone | 6-8 | 1.5-4.0 | 1.5-4.0 |
| Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate | 8-16 | 4-9 | 4-9 |
| Testosterone | 0.2-0.25 | 0.05-0.18 | 0.02-0.12 |
| Estrogen | 0.350 | 0.045 | 0.045 |
| **Changes in Circulating Hormone Levels at Menopause47,157,169** |  |  |  |
|  | *Premenopause* | *Postmenopause* |  |
| Estradiol | 40-400 pg/mL | 10-20 pg/mL |  |
| Estrone | 30-200 pg/mL | 30-70 pg/mL |  |
| Testosterone | 20-80 ng/dL | 15-70 ng/dL |  |
| Androstenedione | 60-300 ng/dL | 30-150 ng/dL |  |

Eventually, the ovarian steroidogenic tissue is exhausted and, despite huge reactive increments in FSH and LH, no further steroidogenesis of importance results from gonadal activity. The postmenopausal ovary weighs less than 10 g, but it can be visualized by ultrasonography.172 With increasing age, the adrenal contribution of precursors for estrogen production proves inadequate. In this final stage of estrogen availability,

levels are insufficient to sustain secondary sex tissues, such as the genitourinary epithelium **(Figure 21.9)**.

**FIGURE 21.9**

In summary, the shift in the endocrine milieu from estrogen dominance of premenopause to the hypoestrogenic and relatively hyperandrogenic milieu of postmenopause underlie the common climacteric and menopausal symptoms, which include:

* Disturbances in menstrual pattern, including anovulation and reduced fertility, decreased flow or hypermenorrhea, irregular frequency of menses, and then, ultimately, amenorrhea

* Vasomotor instability (hot flushes and night sweats)

* Symptomatology of the Genito-Urinary Syndrome of Menopause (GUSM) that results from atrophy of the urogenital epithelium consequent to hypoestrogenism; symptoms include vaginal dryness, dyspareunia and pruritus due to vulvar, introital, and vaginal atrophy; general skin atrophy; and urinary difficulties such as urgency and

abacterial urethritis and cystitis

A precise understanding of the symptom complex an individual woman may manifest and an individualized approach to quantifying symptom burden as well as health risks must be adopted to arrive at the most optimal approach for symptom control for each individual.

**It is helpful to classify the hormonal underpinnings to presenting problems under three distinct categories:**

1. **Those associated with relative estrogen excess, such as abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), endometrial hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer**  
2. **Those associated with estrogen deprivation, such as VMS (hot flushes, night sweats), GUSM symptoms, bone loss, osteoporosis, skeletal fragility, and, to some extent, CVD**  
3. **Those associated with hormone therapy (discussed in Chapter 22\)**

### **SYMPTOMATOLOGY OF PERIMENOPAUSE AND MENOPAUSE**

The period of transition should serve to remind both the patients and the clinicians that this is a time for communication to ensure improvements in patient awareness through education. Certainly, preventive health care education is important throughout life, but at the time of menopause, a review of the major health issues can be especially rewarding. Besides the general issues of good health, attention is appropriately focused on CVD and osteoporosis.

During the transition and early postmenopausal years, in particular, some women may experience significantly bothersome symptoms, whereas others show no reactions or minimal reactions that can go unnoticed. The differences in menopause experience and in the spectrum and severity of symptoms across different cultures are poorly documented, and indeed, it is difficult to do so. Individual reporting is so conditioned by sociocultural

factors that it is hard to determine what is due to biologic versus cultural variability.173,174 For example, there is no word to describe a “hot flush” in Japanese, Chinese, and Mayan.175 Nevertheless, there is reason to believe that the nature and prevalence of menopausal symptoms are common to most women and that variations among cultures and within cultures reflect not physiology but differences in attitudes, lifestyles, socioeconomic status, and individual perceptions across societies.176-181 Hormone levels during the perimenopausal years vary little among different ethnic groups; differences are mainly because of varying body sizes.182

**Abnormal Uterine Bleeding**

The period of transition is characterized by an increasing incidence of anovulatory uterine bleeding. Thus, the late reproductive and early menopausal stages are characterized by longer periods of exposure to unopposed estrogen, of ovarian and extraovarian (from aromatization of androgens) origins. In the SWAN study, about 20% of cycles even early in the menopausal transition were anovulatory, associated with shorter intervals at the beginning of the transition and longer intervals later.183 Irregular bleeding was most often due to anovulation, whereas heavy menstrual bleeding was associated with obesity and uterine abnormalities. The menopause transition and *early* menopause can thus be considered as times of *relative estrogen excess*. Although the greatest concern emerging from prolonged periods of exposure to estrogen unopposed by progesterone (as occurs during periods of anovulation) is of endometrial neoplasia, the most common tissue finding is that of nonneoplastic tissue displaying estrogen effects unopposed by progesterone.

**In addition to the relative excess of estrogen resulting from periods of anovulation, there are four mechanisms that could result in higher endogenous estrogen levels in the perimenopausal and early menopausal women:**

1. **Increased precursor androgen (functional endocrine tumors, liver disease, stress)**

2. **Increased aromatization of androgens (obesity, hyperthyroidism, and liver disease)**

3. **Increased direct secretion of estrogen (ovarian tumors)**

4. **Decreased levels of SHBG leading to increased levels of free estrogen**

In any individual woman presenting with AUB, whether perimenopausal or postmenopausal, whether on or off hormone therapy, specific organic causes for AUB (neoplasia, complications of unexpected pregnancy, or bleeding from extrauterine sites) must be ruled out. Additionally, a systematic evaluation should be undertaken that should include careful history taking and physical examination. A transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) examination should be considered before attempting endometrial sampling for the measurement of endometrial thickness in assessing perimenopausal and postmenopausal AUB to avoid unnecessary endometrial biopsies.184 **In postmenopausal women with AUB, endometrial biopsy is considered unnecessary when the endometrial thickness on ultrasound is less than 4 mm as the risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in this setting is unlikely**.185-188 Substantial evidence is, however, lacking to support the application of this criterion to the premenopausal population. **We believe that biopsy is unnecessary in postmenopausal women when the endometrial thickness is 4 mm or less. We further believe that endometrial biopsy is indicated when the clinical history suggests long-term unopposed estrogen exposure (either prolonged periods of oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea or iatrogenic estrogen use) even when the endometrial thickness is “normal” (5-12 mm for premenopausal women). Furthermore, biopsy should be considered when endometrial thickness is persistently greater than 12 mm even in the absence of AUB, even when clinical suspicion of disease is low. Additionally, if AUB persists in postmenopausal women with an EMT** \<**4 mm, an endometrial biopsy should be performed.** An office procedure has been shown to offer tissue yield that is closely comparable to dilation and curettage (D\&C) and has an 83% sensitivity for detecting endometrial cancer.
