**PR-A-positive breast cells exhibit more aggressive growth, and PR-A isoforms are dominant in the absence of progesterone.** Even without its ligand, PR-A can exert gene regulation in ER-positive breast cell lines.984 In the absence of progesterone, PR-A upregulates genes known to be associated with invasion and poor prognosis, including those genes that provide resistance to apoptosis. In the presence of progesterone, PR-B is a stronger regulator of gene transcription. The breasts of normal women express equal amounts of PR-A and PR-B.

PR-A excess and breast cancer are linked. ER-positive tumors with a higher rate of recurrence are rich in the PR-A isoform.984 As breast cancers become less differentiated, metastatic tumors become dominated by either PR-A or PR-B. PR-A-rich tumors with a low PR-A:PR-B ratio do poorly and respond less well to tamoxifen.985 PR-A excess is also present in breast tissue from women with the *BRCA* mutations.986

Thus, PRs are not just passive markers of estrogen activity. ER+/PR+ tumors are well differentiated and have better outcomes. In the absence of progesterone, the unliganded PR-A can adversely influence the cell biology of ER-positive tumors. Cells rich in PR-A are more likely to be invasive,

poorly differentiated, and aggressive. In monkeys, the breast levels of PR-A were unchanged after 3 years of treatment with conjugated estrogens alone.987 Treatment with conjugated estrogens and MPA produced a decline in PR-A levels, producing a 10-fold beneficial change in the PR-A:PR-B ratio. It is possible that the exposure of an ER-positive tumor to estrogen-progestin treatment can prevent an unfavorable PR-A:PR-B ratio, promoting the beneficial actions of PR-B. In addition, progestins may activate androgen receptors, a factor that has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and cause apoptosis in breast cancer cells.988,989

In a series of in vitro experiments, estradiol and its catechol metabolites induced neoplastic transformation in human breast epithelial cells.990 This, of course, would be consistent with a genomic impact of estrogen that initiates breast cancer, an effect earlier than a promoting influence on already-established cancers. However, it is difficult to transfer in vitro effects on cell lines to the in vivo situation, and this is especially true with breast tissue that is bathed in a complicated and large collection of stimulating and inhibiting substances. Furthermore, the cells in the in vitro experiments were negative for both ER and PR. These receptor-negative malignant cells may well be something different than the receptor-positive tumors associated with postmenopausal HT.

Favorable effects of progestin exposure are reflected in the studies of the association between endogenous hormone levels and the risk of breast cancer. A pooled analysis of nine prospective studies of postmenopausal women concluded that the risk of breast cancer increases with increasing concentrations of all endogenous estrogens and androgens, including estradiol, estrone, estrone sulfate, androstenedione, DHEA, DHEA-S, and testosterone.991 The overall increase in breast cancer risk was about 2-fold comparing the lowest endogenous levels in postmenopausal women with the highest levels. Women who ultimately develop breast cancer do not have different blood levels of progesterone.834 Postmenopausal women who are overweight have an increased risk of breast cancer, and an analysis that adjusted for the increase in circulating estrogens associated with obesity concluded that the increasing risk with increasing body weight is the result of the increase in estrogens.992

In contrast to the endometrium, epithelial cell proliferation in the normal breast and in ER-positive tumors reaches its peak during the

progesterone-dominant luteal phase of the menstrual cycle.963,993-995 This observation has been the driving force behind the argument that progesterone (progestins) is the major hormonal mitogen in the breast. However, studies do not support a major role for an adverse progestational influence. In animal models, it is estrogen that is the major inducer of proliferation and not progesterone. Indeed, evidence indicates that with increasing duration of exposure, progesterone can limit breast epithelial growth as it does with endometrial epithelium.996-998 In vitro studies of normal breast epithelial cells reveal that progestins inhibit proliferation.999 The story with human breast tissue specimens removed after the patients were treated with estradiol and progestin is more confusing, indicating, on one hand, that progestins inhibit in vivo estradiol-induced proliferation996,998,1000 and, on the other hand, markers of epithelial and stromal cell proliferation were higher in women being treated with estrogen-progestin.183,1001 Nevertheless, progestins have been demonstrated to decrease antiapoptotic protein expression,1002 and apoptosis in breast tissue is higher in the luteal phase than in the follicular phase.1003 Conversely, research comparing human breast cancer cell lines to noncancerous cells has demonstrated that progestogens differentially affect breast cell proliferative activity.1004,1005 A study by Courtin et al analyzed the effects of estradiol (E2) alone, E2 \+ progesterone (P4), and E2 \+ MPA on cellular proliferation and apoptosis in breast cancer cells, as well as normal human breast cells.1006 Treatment with E2 alone in all cell types resulted in increased cell proliferation. In normal human breast cells, the addition of P4 blocked estradiol’s proliferative effect and also resulted in an increased number of apoptotic cells. When normal cells were treated with E2+MPA, however, there was little effect on cellular proliferation, and the number of apoptotic cells was decreased. In MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cell lines, MPA did not induce cellular proliferation, and neither MPA nor P4 affected apoptosis in these cells. Microarray studies revealed induction of different sets of genes in hormonally treated cells, compared to control cells. E2+MPA modified genes in a distinctly different pattern from E2+P4. In a study by Sweeney et al, it was found that MPA combined with E2 stimulated proliferation in long-term estrogen-deprived MCF-7 (MCF-7:5C) cells, while E2 alone resulted in cell death.1007 Additional support for progestogens’ role in breast cancer comes from studies analyzing MPA’s

effects on estrogen-metabolizing enzymes in breast cancer cells. Using T-47D and MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), it was demonstrated that E2+MPA increased the expression of estrogen-activating enzymes but not the expression of estrogen-inactivating enzymes.1007 This increase was greater than cells treated with E2 alone. Although there was an increase in estrogen-activating enzymes, there was no associated increase in cell proliferation. It is important to note, however, that locally increased estrogen levels can be seen in the breast cancer cell milieu, and this high-estrogen environment facilitates cancer cell growth.1007 Thus, MPA may exert its carcinogenic effect via induction of a local state of estrogen excess. However, as mentioned earlier, these in vitro models must be interpreted with caution, as what happens in vivo is influenced by many other factors.

In the postmenopausal monkey model, greater breast cell proliferation was observed after 30 months of treatment with estrogen-progestin compared with estrogen alone.1008 In this same model, the administration of progesterone produced no differences in proliferation markers, but adding MPA to estrogen increased breast proliferation by about 30% compared with placebo.1009,1010 However, in this 2-month study, the administration of progesterone inexplicably lowered the blood levels of estradiol and estrone by 30% to 50%, in contrast to no effect with MPA. Thus, the tissue results may reflect estrogen differences, not progestin differences. Nevertheless, the monkey experiments do not detect a beneficial effect of MPA. A 2-year monkey study recorded lower levels of p53, a tumor suppressor gene, and lower levels of caspase-3, an enzyme involved in apoptosis with use of MPA1011 Given the marked similarities in macaques to human gene coding sequences, this primate serves as a more reliable model for studying the effects of menopausal HT on breast cancer acquisition.

A prospective study of premenopausal women in Italy found that higher progesterone levels in the luteal phase were associated with a reduction in breast cancer risk.1012 However, a nested case-control analysis based on the Nurses’ Health Study could find no influence of progesterone levels on breast cancer risk.1013 In this study, women with the highest levels of total and free estradiol in the early follicular phase had about a 2-fold increase in breast cancer risk, predominantly ER+/PR+ tumors, and a similar increase in risk was associated with higher levels of total and free testosterone and androstenedione. There was no association with luteal estradiol levels, and

the authors speculated that this is because early follicular phase levels reflect nonovarian target tissue levels and also that progesterone downregulation of ERs may occur in the breast during the luteal phase.

Although it is not a uniform story, it is possible that favorable breast tissue effects of progestins translate into better differentiation and earlier detection of preexisting tumors. Supporting data can be found in two important American studies. A retrospective cohort study in the Southern California Kaiser program found a reduction in breast cancer case mortality that was significant only among women with breast cancer who were users of estrogen-progestin, not with estrogen alone.1014 An increase in lower-grade, lower-stage, and ER-positive cancer was found only in current users of estrogen-progestin. In a study remarkable for its size, 374,465 women screened in six US mammography centers.851 These data are consistent with a beneficial effect of estrogen-progestin treatment.

Breast cancer mortality was recorded in the Collaborative Breast Cancer Study Cohort, a prospective cohort of 12,269 postmenopausal women from Wisconsin, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire.1015 Women were followed for an average of 10.3 years after breast cancer diagnosis. After adjusting for BMI, smoking, and history of mammography screening, compared with nonusers, mortality from breast cancer was lower among current users of estrogen-progestin and an even greater effect, a 40% reduction, with 5 or more years of use. These are striking data. The strength of the study is the large size of the cohort. Indeed, this is the strongest evidence thus far published that the use of estrogen-progestin is associated with the development of less aggressive breast cancers. Even in studies that adjusted for the prevalence of mammography screening, breast cancers in hormone users were smaller, had fewer positive axillary lymph nodes, and were of lower-grade disease. More recently, a 15-year prospective cohort study published in 2020 provided additional evidence toward the relationship of type and duration of HT and breast cancer risk. Participants included a total of 75,398 postmenopausal women (31,439 with hysterectomy and 43,959 with intact uteri) for whom information on HT use was available at study baseline1016 as well as at a follow-up survey undertaken in 2004 and through 2011\.1017 In estrogen-only users, at baseline, the risk of breast cancer was not increased in current users of ET (HR \= 1.05, 95% CI \= 0.95-1.16); however, estrogen use was associated with an increased risk of breast

cancer in women continuing to use estrogen through 2004 (HR \= 1.35, 95% CI \= 1.04-1.75). In combination (E+P) hormone users, ever use of E+P at baseline was associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (HR \= 1.54, 95% CI \= 1.44-1.64); with ongoing use of E+P, there was a doubling in this risk with 10 or more years of use, and this exaggerated risk persisted in those who continued E+P through 2004 (HR \= 1.80, 95% CI \= 1.39-2.32). Of note, no association was seen in women who discontinued E+P before 2004 (HR \= 1.14, 95% CI \= 0.99-1.30). Based on this large population-based longitudinal study spanning 15 years of follow-up, it appears that while short-term use of estrogen alone may not confer increased risk (consistent with findings from WHI E-alone trial), with long-term use, excess risk may be apparent. Similar to findings from the WHI E+P trial, an increased risk in breast cancer was evident with estrogen plus progestin combination use, and this risk was noted to exaggerate with ongoing long-term HT use.

**The following evidence supports a beneficial impact of progestins on preexisting tumors:**

* **An increase in ER-positive tumors is seen sooner with estrogen-progestin treatment, and greater risk is observed with continuous, daily estrogen-progestin use.**

* **Genes upregulated by estrogen are downregulated by estrogen-progestin therapy.**

* **Genes that are activated by estrogen-progestin are involved in DNA repair and cell cycle regulation.**

* **Progestins decrease breast tissue levels of PR-A, causing a beneficial change in the PR-A:PR-B ratio that is associated with better differentiation and outcome.**

* **A reduction in breast cancer case mortality has been reported with estrogen-progestin use and not estrogen alone.**

**Prevalence of Breast Cancer and Hormone Therapy**

Multiple reports have documented a decline of breast cancer incidence in the United States that paralleled the decrease in use of menopausal HT

following the publications from the WHI hormone trials.1018-1021 A similar decline was documented in France, Scotland, Switzerland, and Australia.1022-1025 The decline was partially influenced by a decrease in screening mammography in the United States, but the correlation with hormone use exists even when the examined population includes only women screened with mammography. A similar pattern was evident in the WHI in the years following the cancelation of the estrogen-progestin arm as well as among the women in the observational arm, despite no change in the frequency of mammography in the WHI population.1026

This decrease in prevalence is consistent with the uniform findings in case-control and cohort studies of an increase in breast cancer risk only in current users, with a rapid reduction after cessation of treatment. An impact on existing tumors is supported by the other side of the coin, apparent in breast cancer statistics derived from the area around Geneva, Switzerland. Beginning in 1997, the peak breast cancer incidence in the Geneva area moved to a younger group of women (ages 60-64), with an increase occurring only in stage I and II diseases with ER-positive tumors in hormone users.1027

As discussed previously, the 20-year follow-up study of WHI hormone trial participants provided valuable insights into long-term effects of a relatively short-term exposure (during the course of WHI hormone trials) to estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone.1017 As was suggested by initial results of the respective WHI hormone trials, at a median of 20-year follow-up, differences in breast cancer incidence persisted in participants of the two WHI hormone trials. The incidence of breast cancers was significantly higher in participants assigned to estrogen plus progestin versus placebo at a median 20 years of follow-up (annualized rate was 0.45% in the E+P arm vs 0.36% in the placebo arm; HR \= 1.28; 95% CI \= 1.13-1.45; *P* \< 0.001). However, despite the exaggerated risk of developing breast cancer in estrogen plus progestin group, there were no significant differences in breast cancer-related mortality between E+P and placebo groups. Not only did the previously observed reduction in breast cancer incidence in the estrogen-alone hormone trial persist at a median of 20 years of follow-up (annualized rate was 0.30% in participants in the E-alone arm vs 0.37% in the placebo group; HR \= 0.78; 95% CI \= 0.65-0.93; *P* \= 0.005), but the risk of  breast  cancer-related  mortality  was  also  significantly  lesser  in

participants of the estrogen-alone arm of WHI compared to placebo (HR \= 0.60; 95% CI \= 0.37-0.97; *P* \= 0.04).1026

The national decline in prevalence and the WHI results are both consistent with an impact of HT on preexisting tumors. If HT is affecting preexisting tumors, one would expect small, undetectable tumors to stop changing (at least temporarily) when women discontinue HT. This response would be consistent with the effects being reported, a decrease in ER-positive tumors in younger postmenopausal women. The data most likely primarily reflect existing cancers just below the detection limit in 2002 that slowed or stopped their growing.

The choice of estrogen used in the estrogen-alone arm of the WHI (CEE) has been suggested as one factor that may explain the favorable effects seen on the breast in the E-alone hormone trial. The CEE formulation contains a mixture of multiple estrogens, and each estrogen type not only preferentially binds the two ERs (ER-a and ER-β) but may also exert differential actions depending on the target tissue.1028,1029 In studying the effects of 11 equine estrogens (in CEE preparations) on the transcriptional activity of ER-a and ER-β, it was found that many of the equine estrogens preferentially bind ER-β. ER-β activation can inhibit ER-a activity on cell proliferation.1030-1032 The potential SERM-like properties of CEE have also been demonstrated in breast cancer cells treated with CEE and estradiol, where CEE and estradiol were noted to have distinct effects on gene expression.1033 Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that several estrogenic compounds in CEE act as partial estrogen agonists; thus, like SERMs, the differences in binding and downstream cell signaling may afford CEE with specific tissue manifestations that are unlike estradiol’s purely stimulatory effects (ie, manifestation of ER antagonistic effects).1033,1034 This inhibition induced by equine estrogens may in part explain the decreased risk of breast cancer in the WHI estrogen-alone study; however, additional research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. The theory that CEE may reduce the risk of breast cancer is supported by 20-year follow-up data from WHI discussed earlier that showed a significantly reduced risk of breast cancer in participants of WHI E-alone hormone trial.1035

Lastly, the SERM BZA paired with a CEE may further allow for favorable effects on breast tissue; BZA/CEE also has the added benefit of

avoiding a progestin.231

**Hormone Therapy and the *BRCA* Mutations**

Women with either *BRCA1* or *BRCA2* germline mutations are advised to undergo bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy after completion of childbearing because of a high lifetime risk (\~90%) for developing breast or ovarian cancer. This surgery reduces the risk of ovarian cancer by about 90% and the risk of breast cancer by about 50%. These relatively young women must consider the postoperative consequences of surgical menopause in their decision-making. In a cohort of 462 women with *BRCA1/2* mutations from 13 medical centers in North America and Europe, the incidence of breast cancer was compared in 155 of the women who had undergone bilateral prophylactic oophorectomy with 307 women who did not have the operation.1036 The women who had oophorectomy had a 60% reduction in the risk of developing breast cancer.

**HT of any type did not alter the reduction in breast cancer experienced by the women undergoing oophorectomy.** Thus, short-term use (several years) of HT did not have an adverse effect on the beneficial reduction in breast cancer risk following prophylactic oophorectomy. In a later follow-up of this group of women, 93 (60%) of the women who underwent oophorectomy used HT.1037 The average length of follow-up was

2.6 years (\>5 years in 16%) in the surgically treated group and 4.1 years (\>5 years in 33%) in the nonoophorectomized group. There was no hint of a

difference in breast cancer reduction comparing hormone users and nonusers. The findings were similar in 34 women who used a combination of estrogen and progestin, but the power of this finding was limited by the small number in this category.

A case-control study of 472 postmenopausal women with a *BRCA1* mutation found that women who used HT after prophylactic oophorectomy, either estrogen only or combined estrogen-progestin, not only did not have an increased risk of breast cancer, but hormone use was actually associated with a decreased risk.1038 The findings were the same regardless of duration of use, or if it was current or past use. This conclusion is encouraging but limited by the fact that 68% of the tumors in the study were ER-negative, making the ER-positive tumors (that are more likely to be influenced by hormone use) relatively small in number. More recently, HT-related risk for breast cancer in *BRCA1* mutation previvors (without prior history of cancer) who had undergone risk-reducing oophorectomy was examined in a prospective multicenter, multinational cohort study.1039 Participants were enrolled between 1995 and 2017, with a mean follow-up of 7.6 years. The use of HT was assessed based on questionnaires administered every 2 years. The study included 872 *BRCA1* mutation carriers (mean age 43 ± 8.5 years). Over a mean postoophorectomy follow-up of 7.6 years (range, 0.4-22.1), the use of HT (ever use, any type vs never use) was not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (HR \= 0.97, 95% CI \= 0.62-1.52; *P*

\= 0.89). The results of this study offer reassurance for premenopausal *BRCA1* mutation carriers, considering risk-reducing oophorectomy regarding the relative safety of HT.

Women who are *BRCA* carriers face difficult decisions. **The experience thus far indicates that HT can be used safely for several years.** Continuing follow-up of these patients may extend this period of safety even longer. A *TSEC* (CEE paired with an SERM BZA) may be particularly suitable HT option in this population, given its efficacy for symptom control and skeletal benefit while having neutral effects on the breast and potential of BZA for blockade of breast cancer cell proliferation, as has been demonstrated in vitro.231,232,1033 However, future studies are needed to establish both safety and efficacy of this newer class of menopausal hormonal regimen in breast cancer survivors as well as those who are at risk for breast cancer, such as *BRCA1/2* carriers.

Prophylactic oophorectomy in women with *BRCA* mutations reduces the risk of breast cancer by about 50%. Thus far, hormone use after prophylactic oophorectomy has not diminished the beneficial reduction in breast cancer risk.

Hormone receptor status of breast cancer cells itself, regardless of hormone use, may be relevant to future prognosis in carriers of *BRCA* mutation. A multicenter, retrospective cohort study examined the impact of hormone receptor status on clinical behavior and outcomes of breast cancer in a cohort of young *BRCA* mutation carriers (aged :\<40 years, *n* \= 4,709) diagnosed with invasive breast cancer; 2,143 (45.5%) had hormone receptor-positive and 2,566 (54.5%) hormone receptor-negative breast cancers.1040 At a median follow-up duration of 7.9 years, compared to patients with hormone receptor-negative disease, those with hormone receptor-positive cancers experienced a significantly higher rate of distant recurrences (13.1% vs 9.6%, *P* \< 0.001), but significantly lesser incidence of a second primary breast cancer (9.1% vs 14.7%, *P* \< 0.001). The 8-year disease-free survival, however, was comparable in patients with hormone receptor-positive and hormone receptor-negative disease.

**Summary: Postmenopausal Hormone Therapy and Breast Cancer**

**Postmenopausal HT may be associated with a small increase in the risk of breast cancer. Of course, even a small increase in risk for breast cancer is frightening for patients to contemplate. It is helpful to remind patients of the risk of lung cancer associated with smoking** (**RR** \= **10-20**)**, a risk magnitude that provides perspective on the possible risk associated with HT. It is also worth pointing out that the reported risk with HT is even smaller than that associated with recognized risk factors, such as a positive family history, being overweight after menopause, and alcohol intake. In our view, because the literature is sufficiently strong, it is appropriate to share with patients an alternative explanation for the epidemiologic reports regarding breast cancer and postmenopausal HT. It is helpful to emphasize the possibility that the studies reflect an effect of HT on preexisting tumors and that hormone users who develop breast cancer have a reduced risk of dying of breast cancer because their tumors are better differentiated, more localized, and smaller. Contrary to the prevailing belief, estrogen-progestin exposure may cause greater differentiation and earlier detection of preexisting tumors, resulting in better outcomes.**

### **ENDOMETRIAL NEOPLASIA**

There are two different types of endometrial cancer. The more common form, *endometrioid* carcinoma, develops slowly from a precursor lesion in response to estrogen stimulation. This type is less aggressive, is better differentiated, and responds to progestational treatment. In contrast, the uncommon form (perhaps 10-20%) develops rapidly, usually in older women, with a histologic pattern that is more characteristic of serous or clear cell carcinomas, in a background of atrophic endometrium.

Estrogen normally promotes mitotic growth of the endometrium. Abnormal progression of growth through simple hyperplasia, complex hyperplasia, atypia, and early carcinoma has been associated with unopposed estrogen activity, administered either continuously or in cyclic manner. **Only 1 year of treatment with unopposed estrogen** (**0.625-mg conjugated estrogens or the equivalent**) **will produce a 20% incidence of endometrial hyperplasia, largely simple hyperplasia.** In the 3-year PEPI trial, 30% of the women on unopposed estrogen developed adenomatous or atypical hyperplasia.108,111,112 Some 10% of women with complex hyperplasia progress to frank cancer, and complex hyperplasia is observed to antedate adenocarcinoma in 25% to 30% of cases. **If histologic evidence of atypia is present, 20% to 25% of these cases will progress to carcinoma within a year.**1041

Multiple case-control and cohort studies have estimated that the risk of endometrial cancer in women on ET (unopposed by a progestational agent) is increased by a factor of somewhere from b.i.d. to 10 times the background incidence of 1 per 1,000 postmenopausal women per year.1042,1043 **The risk increases with the dose of estrogen and with the duration of exposure** (reaching a 10-fold increase with 10-15 years of use, perhaps an incidence of 1 in 10 with very long-term use) **and lingers for up to 10 years after estrogen is discontinued.**1044-1046 The risk of cancer that has already spread beyond the uterus is increased 3-fold in women who have used systemic estrogen for a year or longer.1044,1047 Although most endometrial cancer associated with estrogen use is of low grade and stage, and associated with better survival (probably because of early detection), the overall risk of invasive cancer and death is increased. The risk of endometrial hyperplasia and cancer is not reduced by the administration of unopposed estrogen in a cyclic manner (a period of time each month without treatment).1042,1048

Dose as well as duration of estrogen exposure are both relevant to endometrial risk. A short-term study (2 years) indicated that estrogen-only treatment in one-half the usual standard dose of estrogen (in this case, 0.3 mg esterified estrogens) was not associated with an increased incidence of endometrial hyperplasia compared with a placebo group.1049 In a similar 2-year study, endometrial stimulation with the transdermal delivery of a very low dose of estradiol, 14 μg/d, also did not differ compared with placebo.1050 However, **we have learned that long-term exposure to low levels of estrogen can also induce abnormal endometrial growth** (**it just takes longer**)**, and, in our view, lower dose ET requires either ongoing endometrial assessment, perhaps annually, or the addition of a progestin to the treatment regimen.** This is supported by a case-control study from Washington that contained 18 cases and 9 controls who had exclusively used only 0.3 mg/d of unopposed conjugated estrogens.1051 The use of this half-dose estrogen was associated with an overall 5-fold increased risk of endometrial cancer, reaching an RR of 9.2 in current users for more than 8 years’ duration. Although limited by small numbers, the conclusion is logical and consistent with our understanding of the importance of duration of exposure to any increased level of endometrial estrogen stimulation. In a randomized trial, endometrial hyperplasia was increased after 2 years of treatment with 0.3 mg conjugated estrogens without a progestin.114

**The risk of endometrial excessive proliferation is reduced by the addition of a progestational agent to the treatment regimen**.108,112 Although estrogen promotes the growth of endometrium, progestins inhibit that growth. This counter effect is accomplished by progestin-induced reduction in cellular receptors for estrogen and by induction of target cell enzymes that convert estradiol to the excreted metabolite estrone sulfate. As a result, the number of ER complexes that are retained in the endometrial nuclei is decreased, as is the overall intracellular availability of the powerful estradiol. In addition, progestational agents suppress estrogen-mediated transcription of oncogenes.

Reports of the clinical impact of adding progestin in sequence with estrogen include both the reversal of hyperplasia and a diminished incidence of endometrial cancer.1052-1057 The protective action of progestational agents operates via a mechanism that requires time in order

to reach its maximal effect. For that reason, the duration of exposure to the progestin each month is critical. Studies indicate that in estrogen users, the *minimal* requirement for progestin exposure is for a period of 10 days each month.1058-1060 More recently, this recommendation has been extended to 12 to 14 days of progestin exposure each month. **About 2% to 3% of estrogen-using women per year develop endometrial hyperplasia when the progestin is administered for less than 10 days monthly.**

Important unanswered questions are the following: What is the actual incidence of endometrial cancer in very long-term users of postmenopausal HT, and are there differences among the various regimens and routes of administration? A case-control study from Seattle reported that the use of combined estrogen-progestin (essentially all sequential and oral) for 5 years or more was associated with an increased RR of endometrial cancer, even with 10 to 21 days of added progestin per month.1061 However, the increased risk was confined to those women who had been previously exposed to unopposed estrogen treatment; it is important to remember that **after discontinuing unopposed estrogen treatment, the risk of endometrial cancer lingers for up to 10 years, even if a subsequent regimen includes a progestin.** In the Swedish prospective cohort in Uppsala, a reduced risk of mortality due to endometrial cancer was observed in women receiving an estrogen-progestin combination; however, there were only two deaths, precluding statistical significance.723 A case-control study from Los Angeles found no increased risk of endometrial cancer with the continuous, combined estrogen-progestin regimen or when at least 10 days of progestin were provided in a sequential regimen.1060 **Epidemiologic studies have suggested that continuous, combined estrogen-progestin regimens provide superior protection against endometrial cancer. Long-term sequential regimens still carry a small increase in the risk of endometrial cancer.**145,1062,1063 **In our view, periodic endometrial surveillance** (**annual sonohysterogram and/or endometrial biopsy**) **is recommended in estrogen users exposed only intermittently to progestin treatment.**

It is not an uncommon perception that protection against endometrial cancer requires periodic “shedding” of the endometrium. However, we know that at least one-third and up to one-half of the functioning endometrium are not lost during withdrawal bleeding, and it has not been

established that endometrial shedding is essential to protect against cancer.1064 It is just as logical to believe that prevention of growth with the development of atrophic endometrium is protective. Case-control studies have indicated that not only is the excess risk associated with unopposed estrogen prevented by continuous, combined estrogen-progestin regimens, but with increasing duration of use, the risk of endometrial cancer is lower than that in never users.1062,1065 In a small number of women who developed hyperplasia on a sequential regimen, conversion to continuous, combined treatment produced a return to normal endometrium, and in 345 women who completed 5 years of treatment with a continuous, combined regimen, not a single case of hyperplasia was detected.129

The WHI reported a 21% decrease in endometrial cancers in the canceled estrogen-progestin arm after 5 years of this clinical trial, although this difference was not statistically significant.1066

The lowest daily dose of progestin that protects the endometrium has not been established. Currently, the sequential program with conjugated estrogens uses 5 or 10 mg MPA, and the combined daily method uses 1.5 or

2.5 mg. A 2-year study has indicated that 1.5 mg MPA combined with 0.3 or 0.45 mg conjugated estrogens effectively prevents endometrial hyperplasia.114 The dose of norethindrone that is comparable with 2.5 mg MPA is 0.25 mg.115 The French E3N cohort study has demonstrated that endometrial safety effects vary by the type of progestin; the risk of endometrial cancer in estrogen users was higher when micronized progesterone and dydrogesterone were used compared to other progestin formulations.1067

**Although the protective effect of progestin is considerable and predictable, it is unwise to expect all patients on estrogen-progestin therapy to never develop endometrial cancer. Appropriate monitoring of patients cannot be disregarded. Although routine assessments are not cost-effective, interventions directed by clinical responses are prudent and necessary. Greater surveillance is warranted in women on sequential estrogen-progestin regimens.**

A relevance of obesity and insulin resistance for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer is increasingly recognized.1035,1068 This relationship is independent of exogenous hormone use and underscores the need for
