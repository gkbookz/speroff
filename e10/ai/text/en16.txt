### **IMPLICATIONS OF HORMONE THERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH LIVER DISEASE**

In an evaluation of liver chemistries in a group of patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, standard HT doses produced no adverse changes over a period of 1 year.1221 Estrogen treatment, either oral or transdermal, has not been associated with worsening cholestasis in women with primary biliary cirrhosis.1222,1223 We recommend measurement of liver chemistries after 1

month of treatment and every 6 months, with continuing HT in the absence of deterioration.

A French cohort study concluded that HT protects against the progression of hepatic fibrosis from chronic hepatitis C.1224 Most individuals with hepatitis C virus infection develop chronic disease, a major cause of worldwide morbidity and mortality from liver fibrosis. The time course is relatively slow, taking years to progress from infection to cirrhosis. Progression is increased by consumption of alcohol, excess body weight, diabetes, and the degree of fatty degeneration in the liver. The severity of liver fibrosis is greater in men, and progression in women accelerates around age 60\. In vitro and animal experiments have documented a beneficial effect of estrogen on the development of fibrosis, an effect that is consistent with the data in the French study finding greater progression of fibrosis after menopause and amelioration with HT. Another French study, a retrospective survey, reported a greater rate of fibrosis progression with hepatitis C in postmenopausal and nulliparous women and a lower rate in postmenopausal women treated with HT compared with nontreated women.1225

Liver fibrosis from hepatitis C infection is not the result of viral destruction of hepatic cells. Fibrosis is a response to the inflammatory activity incited by the virus. By now, it is well known that estrogen can suppress the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Because of the prevalence of hepatitis C infection, these French reports are very important. Many clinicians are reluctant to prescribe HT to women with a history of liver disease. However, as long as liver enzymes are normal, there is no reason to withhold treatment, and these French studies indicate that ET is beneficial. Postmenopausal HT should be discussed when women present with a history of hepatitis C infection.

The lesson learned from the earlier-mentioned conditions is that estrogen-alone and estrogen-progestin treatment including contraception is acceptable as long as liver enzyme function is normal. This caveat is also true for women who have undergone organ transplantation surgery.1226

**HT should be avoided in the setting of chronically impaired liver function.**

### **HORMONE TREATMENT IN THE PRESENCE OF UTERINE LEIOMYOMAS (FIBROIDS)**

Uterine leiomyomas are monoclonal tumors that retain sensitivity to both estrogen and progestin (see Chapter 3); therefore, it is appropriate to be concerned over whether leiomyomas will grow in response to postmenopausal HT. As assessed by vaginal ultrasonography, the number and size of uterine leiomyomas increased in women being treated with an intramuscular depot form of estrogen-progestin therapy.1227 However, the hormonal dose in this study was relatively high, certainly higher than standard regimens. At the end of 1 year, women with small asymptomatic fibroids administered with a daily combination of 0.625-mg conjugated estrogens and 2.5-mg MPA had no sonographic evidence of growth in contrast to an increase in size observed with transdermal estradiol (50 μg) and 5-mg MPA daily (a response that probably reflects the effect of a higher progestin dose).1228 In follow-up studies with standard doses of estrogen-progestin or tibolone, ultrasonography detected no changes in uterine or myoma volumes.1229-1231 Clinical experience indicates that fibroid tumors of the uterus almost always are not stimulated to grow by the commonly utilized postmenopausal doses of estrogen and progestin. Tibolone and raloxifene also do not stimulate myoma growth.320,1232,1233 Interestingly, however, a vulvar leiomyoma with growth stimulated by estrogen-progestin treatment has been reported.1234 A case-control study could find no statistically significant increase in the risk of uterine sarcomas associated with ET.1235 **Nevertheless, in women with known fibroids, periodic surveillance by pelvic examination and TVUS scans is prudent.**

### **IMPLICATIONS OF HORMONE THERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH SLEEP APNEA**

The low prevalence of sleep apnea in premenopausal women and the increased frequency after menopause suggest a hormonal link. In careful studies, however, postmenopausal HT had no significant adverse effect on sleep-disordered breathing in women with more than mild obstructive sleep apnea.1236,1237  And  other  sleep  laboratory  studies  found  that  estrogen

treatment reduced difficulties with sleep-disordered breathing.1238-1240 The slight rise in basal body temperature induced by a progestational agent may be sufficient to disrupt the quality of sleep in some women, a problem that may be more noticeable with a sequential regimen and with nighttime administration.

### **IMPLICATIONS OF HORMONE THERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH ASTHMA**

In some women, changes in asthma activity have been noted to correlate with the phases of the menstrual cycle. The impact of postmenopausal HT on asthma activity has not been well investigated, but there is an indication that estrogen has an adverse effect. A worsening in spirometry assessment was detected in asthmatics after ET; however, the difference was judged to be subclinical, and the patients did not report any changes in their perceptions of symptoms.1241 A similar study could detect no adverse effects with either discontinuation or reinitiation of estrogen treatment.1242 And another study concluded that ET improved asthma and decreased the need for glucocorticosteroid treatment.1243 In a prospective assessment of a cohort of women, the use of postmenopausal HT (estrogen with or without progestin) was associated with a 50% increase in the risk of developing adult-onset asthma, and the risk was greater with long-term use and higher doses of estrogen.1244 Similar results were reported in the French E3N cohort study, except an increased risk was observed only in estrogen-alone users.1245 In the Nurses’ Health Study, newly diagnosed asthma was increased about 2-fold by HT.1246 Because hormonal changes may precipitate asthmatic activity (eg, catamenial asthma), attention should be directed to the symptomatic pattern and consideration given to the daily, continuous, combined regimen.

### **MENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY, DEMENTIA, AND COGNITION**

The WHIMS analyzed the effects of HT on cognition and on risk of dementia in postmenopausal women participating in the WHI hormone trials. Contrary to earlier assumptions that menopausal ET should offer cognitive benefit, the WHIMS concluded that estrogen-progestin and estrogen-only therapy actually increased the risk for dementia in women aged 65 years and above and did not prevent mild cognitive impairment.1247-1250 However, the only statistically significant finding in the estrogen-progestin arm was increased dementia (vascular dementia, not Alzheimer disease) in older women (22 cases in the treated group and 10 cases in the placebo group) aged 75 years and above and who had been exposed to a relatively short term of estrogen-progestin therapy. The estrogen-only arm of the WHI contained more women who are obese with preexisting CVD, and the trend for an increase in dementia likely reflected an effect in older women with established atherosclerosis. A 2019 randomized placebo-controlled trial noted a faster decline in immediate list recall and a slower decline in story recall in ET use. However, like the WHI/WHIMS trials, average age was more than 10 years from menopause.1251 Both *timing* and *duration* hypothesis, similar to ones proposed for cardiovascular effects of HT, emerged in the wake of WHIMS, raising questions that outcomes may differ for those women who initiate HT early in the course of menopause and in those who following early initiation continue to use HT for longer durations; hypotheses proposed that unlike WHIMS, women initiating HT proximate to final menses and who then continue to use hormones for prolonged periods may be protected against dementia. The WHI report recognized that these hypotheses could not be tested in this clinical trial because of the older age of the study participants and remoteness of hormone initiation from the onset of menopause. A prospective study of a homogeneous population in Utah (thus minimizing, if not eliminating, the healthy user bias) concluded that a reduction in the risk of Alzheimer required long-term treatment, initiated at least 10 years before symptoms of dementia appear.1252 Thus, any favorable effects of HT on cognition and on the risk of Alzheimer disease, if any, appear to be limited to women who initiate treatment close to onset of menopause. However, KEEPSCog, an ancillary study to KEEPS that examined the timing hypothesis as regards the effects of HT initiated within 3 years of the onset of menopause, similarly failed to identify cognitive benefit.1253

### **OTHER CONDITIONS**

Close surveillance is indicated for some patients with seizure disorders and migraine headaches. Patients with migraine headaches often improve with strategies that minimize fluctuations in circulating hormone levels that can serve to trigger headaches. Transdermal route of estrogen administration is preferable, given a stable hormone profile in comparison to following oral ingestion. Conditions that do not represent contraindications include controlled hypertension, smoking, and varicose veins. The belief that estrogen is potentially harmful with each of these clinical situations is derived from old studies of high-dose oral contraceptives. Estrogen in appropriate postmenopausal doses is acceptable in the presence of these conditions.

No other cancers (in addition to those mentioned previously) are known to be adversely affected by HT. Postmenopausal HT can be administered to all patients with a history of cervical, ovarian, or vulvar malignancies.

Highly unusual anecdotal happenings include the following:

* Provocation of chorea by ET in a woman with a history of Sydenham chorea1254

* Exacerbation of pulmonary leiomyomatosis by ET1255

* Psychiatric symptoms in response to estrogen in patients with acute intermittent porphyria1256

* Idiosyncratic ocular symptoms associated with estrogen1257

* Sudden deafness and tinnitus with commencement of HT1258

* Resolution	of	an	infection	with	*Trichomonas	vaginalis*	after discontinuation of estrogen-progestin therapy1259

* Successful treatment of Sjögren syndrome with tibolone1260

### **BEYOND SYMPTOM CONTROL**

*Some Additional Benefits of Hormone Therapy*

**Estrogen Therapy and Autoimmune Diseases**

***Rheumatoid Arthritis***

No clear conclusion is apparent from the studies of effects of estrogen on rheumatic diseases, especially rheumatoid arthritis. Some have indicated that exogenous estrogen, either in oral contraceptives or as postmenopausal therapy, protects against the onset of rheumatoid arthritis, whereas other studies find no such effect.1261-1264 Existing data are hampered by small numbers. In a randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial, maintenance of standard serum estradiol levels was associated with improvements in some measurements of disease activity in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.1265 Reassuringly, there has been no evidence that postmenopausal HT aggravates rheumatoid arthritis or causes a flare in disease activity. **Postmenopausal HT can be safely considered in symptomatic postmenopausal women with rheumatoid arthritis. HT can additionally be considered as a fracture risk reduction strategy in appropriately selected patients** (skeletal effects of HT are discussed in the section on osteoporosis)**.**

***Systemic Lupus Erythematosus***

In the Nurses’ Health Study, the use of postmenopausal estrogen was associated with approximately a 2-fold increase in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an observation based on 30 cases in past and current users of estrogen.1266 In a follow-up of 60 postmenopausal women with stable SLE, no adverse effects of HT could be detected.1267 Patients with SLE develop early atherosclerosis, and those treated with glucocorticoids are especially at greater risk for osteoporosis,1268 but there is a concern that exogenous estrogen will increase flares and stimulate thrombosis because of an existing hypercoagulable state in these patients. Importantly, no increase in arterial or venous thrombosis was observed with postmenopausal HT in a longitudinal study of a large cohort of US women with SLE.1269 **Postmenopausal HT can be considered in patients with stable or inactive disease, without renal involvement, or high antiphospholipid antibodies, and transdermal route for estrogen administration is advised.**

**Estrogen Therapy and Osteoarthritis**

Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis in older people, and its prevalence increases rapidly in women after menopause. Increasing severity of osteoarthritis of the knee has been reported to be associated with increasing bone density and the current use of postmenopausal HT in middle-aged women.1270 However, estrogen treatment reduced osteoarthritis in a monkey model, and a cross-sectional study concluded that current users of estrogen had a reduced prevalence of osteoarthritis of the hip, and there was protection against the severity of osteoarthritis, with a greater effect with longer duration of use.1271,1272 Arthritic complaints are a major side effect of the low estrogen state induced in women with breast cancer treated with AIs, and osteoarthritis develops more frequently in women with the lowest levels of estrogen.1273,1274 Because there are no known treatments that modify the course of osteoarthritis, this potential benefit of postmenopausal HT deserves study in appropriately designed randomized clinical trials.

**Estrogen Therapy and the Oral Cavity**

Oral complaints are common among postmenopausal women. The administration of estrogen provides significant relief from oral discomfort, burning, bad taste, and dryness.1275 ET is also associated with a reduction in periodontal disease, including gingival inflammation and bleeding.1276,1277 These changes may reflect epithelial responses to estrogen by the oral mucosa, in a manner similar to that of the vaginal mucosa. Oral alveolar bone loss (which can lead to loss of teeth) is strongly correlated with osteoporosis, and the salutary effect of estrogen on skeletal bone mass (discussed later in the section on osteoporosis) is also manifested on oral bone.1278,1279 In the Leisure World Cohort, tooth loss and edentia were significantly reduced in estrogen users compared with nonusers (with a reduced need for dentures), and this beneficial effect was greater with increasing duration of estrogen use.1280 Approximately a 25% reduced risk of tooth loss in current users of estrogen was observed in the Nurses’ Health Study.1281

**Estrogen Therapy and the Larynx**

Professional singers have used HT to prevent what they view as unwanted voice changes associated with menopause.1282 In prospective studies, objective voice analyses have documented a more androgenic change in voice in the early postmenopausal years with a lesser change associated with estrogen treatment; although slightly attenuated by the addition of a progestin, the overall effect of estrogen treatment is to preserve voice quality.1283-1285 Laryngeal cytology demonstrated epithelial maturation in women on estrogen treatment, and these women reported better voice quality and fewer voice changes compared with a control group.1286

**Estrogen Therapy and Vision**

There is some evidence that ET improves visual acuity (or lessens the visual deterioration during the early postmenopausal years), perhaps due to a beneficial effect on lacrimal fluid.1287,1288 An increased prevalence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes) in menopausal and postmenopausal women, with symptoms of scratchiness, burning, and photophobia, is recognized by ophthalmologists.1289 Although reports concluded that there was no effect or even a worsening of dry eyes with HT, a clinical trial indicated relief from dry eye symptoms with the use of topical estrogen eye drops.1290-1294  
There is evidence that postmenopausal ET protects against cataracts.1295-

1299 Estrogen-alone or estrogen-progestin treatment also lowers intraocular pressure in postmenopausal women with normal eyes or glaucoma.1293,1300-1302 In the Nurses’ Health Study, current use of estrogen-progestin, but not estrogen alone, was associated with a reduced risk of glaucoma.1303 In a retrospective study of female veterans with open-angle glaucoma, HT tended to older at the diagnosis of glaucoma.1304 There is modest and inconsistent evidence that the risk of age-related macular degeneration is reduced in postmenopausal hormone users.1305-1310

**Estrogen Therapy and Age-Related Hearing Loss**

Demineralization of the cochlear capsule occurs with aging and metabolic bone diseases, such as cochlear otosclerosis. This demineralization is associated with neural hearing loss. Postmenopausal women (age 60-85 years) who have lower than average femoral neck bone mass have an

increased risk of having a hearing loss.1311 This association between femoral neck bone mass and age-related hearing loss suggests that prevention of bone loss with ET might also be exerted on the cochlear capsule. In addition, estrogen may have beneficial effects on cochlear blood flow and central nervous system auditory neurons. Hearing impairment in a Turkish family was associated with an inactivating mutation for ER-β.1312 Mouse knockout studies indicate that ER-β is important for the prevention of age-related hearing loss.1313 Studies have documented better hearing levels in estrogen users, with an indication that the addition of a progestin attenuated the favorable effect of estrogen.1314,1315 Interestingly, however, older age at menopause and longer duration of postmenopausal HT were associated with a higher risk of hearing loss.1316

### **HOW LONG SHOULD POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY BE CONTINUED?**

The answer to this question is relatively straightforward. Periodic reassessments of risk-to-benefit ratio must be undertaken in hormone-using women, and **duration of therapy should be guided by the principles of “net benefit” and “do no harm.”** Clarity on persistence of the indication for which HT was initiated in the first place and overall risk profile of the user should be periodically assessed, and a woman should continue their menopausal hormone regimen if the potential for benefit outweighs that of harm.1317 The symptom, metabolic, and skeletal effects of hormones revert early following discontinuation, with longer times needed for others may take years (eg, dissipation in breast cancer risk) after discontinuation.

Resurgence in menopausal symptoms after discontinuing HT is not uncommon, and resulting disruption in quality of life has been reported in at least 25% of previously treated women and, in one Swedish study, 70%.1318,1319 It seems intuitively advantageous to encourage a tapering, gradual discontinuation program to minimize recurrence of menopausal symptoms, although randomized trials comparing gradual discontinuation with abrupt cessation found no benefit with a tapering regimen.1320-1323 Neither the recurrence rate nor the severity of menopausal symptoms differs comparing the two methods.

### **SHOULD WOMEN REMOTE FROM MENOPAUSE BE STARTED ON HORMONE THERAPY?**

The positive impact of HT on the bone has been demonstrated even in women older than age 65\.1324,1325 This is a strong argument in favor of treating women remote from menopause who have never been on estrogen and who cannot take or afford the other alternatives for bone preservation. Estrogen treatment that is not begun until after age 60 can with long-term use achieve bone densities nearly but not totally comparable with those in women taking estrogen from menopause, and estrogen use between the ages of 65 and 74 has been documented to protect against hip fractures.1326,1327 **Adding a hormonal regimen to women over the age of 60 is, however, not a trivial consideration, given the known risks of thromboembolism, stroke, and cognitive deterioration that were evident in the WHI hormone trials.** This judgment requires the conclusion that a relatively youthful and vigorous older woman has something to gain from the choice of hormone treatment. While patients with osteoporosis may qualify, alternative effective strategies are available to minimize fracture risk, which may prove to be safer alternatives to HT in the older adults. The primary and secondary prevention trials reviewed in this chapter have strongly indicated that estrogen administered to women with established atherosclerosis is associated with an increased risk of arterial thrombosis. The mechanism, as reviewed in earlier in this chapter, is presumed to be the creation of a prothrombotic environment by the stimulation of metalloproteinase enzyme activity in unstable atherosclerotic plaques. This effect is enhanced by the production of 27-hydroxycholesterol in atherosclerotic sites, a cholesterol metabolite that competitively inhibits estrogen’s beneficial actions within blood vessels. Statin treatment is known to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques rapidly, within 3 months. Although there are no studies to support this recommendation, it seems reasonable to consider initiating statin treatment for several months before starting ET in older women; such a consideration requires a thorough discussion on alternative options and on the net balance of risks versus benefits of HT remote from menopause onset, toward shared decision-making. In 2017,1328 after review of existing data on benefits versus risks of HT, the United

States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against postmenopausal women taking HT (combined E+P or E alone) for the sole purpose of preventing chronic conditions. **The USPSTF recommendations were revised in 2022 and stood firm in advising against postmenopausal women taking combined HT for the sole purpose of preventing chronic conditions**.1329

Older women who have been deficient in estrogen for many years often experience side effects when standard doses of estrogen are initiated. Breast tenderness can be especially disturbing. Because of these side effects and the experience in the WHI with its older population, it is better to start older women with lower doses, and transdermal products that deliver low amounts of estrogen must be considered preferentially. The benefits from initiating HT in aging women must be balanced against risks for harm, and a thorough clinician-patient dialogue must place existing data in perspective, including findings from the WHI hormone trials.

### **CAN THE DIET PRODUCE VARIATIONS IN SYSTEMIC ESTROGEN LEVELS?**

Oral estrogens have an extensive first-pass metabolism, both in the gastrointestinal tract and the liver. This metabolism consists chiefly of sulfation and hydroxylation. The cytochrome P-450 system catalyzes the hydroxylation of estrogen, and antioxidants can inhibit this action. Flavonoids (eg, naringenin and quercetin) are present in high concentrations in fruits and vegetables, and grapefruit juice inhibits estrogen metabolism, producing an increase in bioavailability that is consistent with an inhibition of hydroxylation.1330,1331 This raises the possibility that dietary interactions with food products could produce a clinical impact. There is great variability within individuals and between individuals in the pharmacokinetics of exogenously administered estrogen. It is possible that this variability partially reflects the dietary habits of individuals and not intrinsic metabolism.

An effect of alcohol ingestion by premenopausal women was not demonstrated on circulating levels of estrone, estradiol, DHEA-S, or SHBG in a cross-sectional study that depended on a questionnaire to assess alcohol

intake.1332 However, when alcohol is administered under experimental conditions, circulating estrogen concentrations are raised to high levels.1333,1334 In a prospective cohort study of premenopausal women in Italy, higher estradiol levels were correlated with an increased alcohol intake over a 1-year period of time.1335 In the past decade, the gut microbiome has emerged as an important variable capable of influencing estrogen metabolism, the metabolic and carcinogenic milieu, as well as modifying interactions between dietary factors and hormones.1336

### **CLINICAL APPROACH TO POSTMENOPAUSAL HORMONE THERAPY**

We hope that the readers can appreciate that menopause is a normal life event, which, just like puberty, may be challenging for some, and that for many women who are challenged by menopause-related bother, menopausal HT can bring about marked improvement in quality of life. Furthermore, with long-term use, menopausal HT may offer health benefits that extend beyond symptom control. Menopausal HT should be considered for symptomatic women traversing the menopause transition and early menopause as they consider their paths for successful aging; the decision to initiate HT should be made after weighing individualized risks against patient’s symptom burden and indicated benefits. **It is important to appreciate that the attitude and beliefs of the clinician have a major influence on the treatment-related decisions made by patients.** As beneficial as the impact of HT may be, we must also emphasize the large improvement in health to be gained by lifestyle changes that include cessation of smoking, attention to diet and exercise, control of body weight, and attention to stress reduction.

It is the task of an epidemiologist to derive study conclusions based on research data. It is the obligation of a clinician to make a judgment whether the epidemiologist’s conclusions have clinical meaning. For example, an epidemiologist may conclude that estrogen reduces coronary artery calcification and point out that a randomized clinical trial has not proved that such a reduction lowers the risk of CHD. However, it is appropriate for a clinician, knowing the correlation between coronary artery calcification

and CHD, to conclude that estrogen reduction of coronary calcification will translate into less CHD. **Medical judgments require more than absolute evidence from randomized trials, and medical judgments frequently do not have the luxury of postponing clinically meaningful decisions until data are conclusive.**

Long-term use of menopausal HT is not precluded by the results reported by the WHI. Protection against osteoporotic fractures, reduction in incidence of colorectal cancers and possibly new-onset diabetes mellitus, and a possibility of primary prevention of CHD are some of the long-term benefits, provided HT is initiated for the right patient at the right time. Once HT is initiated, it is incumbent that prescribers remain attentive to interval changes in the user’s health profile and periodically weigh hormone use-related benefits against the known hormone-related risks of VTE, stroke, and breast cancer (from estrogen and progestin use). Prescribers should additionally remain receptive to alternative proven therapies (eg, nonhormonal formulations such as Brisdelle and fezolinetant for vasomotor control, and statins and incretins for metabolic benefit) and to support beneficial lifestyle modifications. It remains the clinician’s responsibility to weigh any purported benefit against HT-related risks for each patient such that potential for benefit from HT outweighs any risk for harm for each and every patient at all time.

**The WHI agrees with 30+ years of research**

* CHD: potential for protection in young postmenopausal women

* Stroke: no increase in early postmenopausal, healthy women

* VTE: 2-fold increase in the first years of use, concentrated in those with preexisting risk factors

* Cancer: slightly increased risk of breast cancer or an effect on preexisting tumors; reduction in colorectal cancer

* Osteoporosis: reduction in vertebral and nonvertebral fractures

* Diabetes mellitus: reduction in new-onset diabetes

A theme has emerged from the epidemiologic confusion of the past few decades. It takes healthy tissue to allow effective response to estrogen and maintenance of health. Experimental evidence in primates and in women

indicates that as cells (endothelial, neurons) age and as atherosclerosis sets in, the potential for net benefit from menopause HT lessens and net risk increases.463,809,1252 Toward maximizing benefit, therefore, initiation of indicated HT should begin closer to the onset of menopause.

The most effective and appropriate method to help in decision-making is to identify the specific goals and objectives of the individual patient—*let your patient be your guide*. Once an individual’s objectives are identified, choices from multiple treatment options can be reviewed. Postmenopausal health and HT are subjects receiving enormous attention and research; therefore, decision-making should be at least an annual event, incorporating new knowledge as it appears. Approached in this manner, the terms “short term” and “long term” and the imposition of time limits for therapy become meaningless. Clinician and patient together make an annual clinical judgment that is appropriately directed to accomplishing the individual patient’s goals. **The guiding principle is the *right* drug in the *right* dose for the *right* patient at the *right* time, and for the appropriate duration according to an individual patient’s needs and tailored to the individual’s unique risk profile.**
