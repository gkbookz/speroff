greater vigilance toward the risk for endometrial pathology in populations who are obese.

### **OVARIAN CANCER**

Prospective cohort studies concluded that the risk of fatal ovarian cancer is increased with long-term estrogen use.1069-1075 In addition, some case-control studies reported a small increase in risk in *ever users* that was higher with long duration of use.1076 However, by no means is it certain if this association between menopausal hormone use and ovarian cancer is real. A pooled analysis of 12 case-control studies could find no consistent evidence for an association between ovarian cancer and ET.1077 A meta-analysis concluded that there is a 14% increased risk of ovarian carcinoma among ever users of HT and that this risk increased to 27% with more than 10 years of hormone use.1078 However, existing data included in this meta-analysis are subject to multiple potential biases. Among the six studies included in the analysis of duration of use, only one reported a statistically significant increase in risk with 10 or more years of hormone use. Another meta-analysis concluded that there was no clear evidence of an increased risk of ovarian cancer with ET and no effect of increasing duration of hormone use.1079

Individual studies have been hampered by relatively small numbers, but the lack of a uniform and consistent association argues against a major impact of postmenopausal estrogen treatment on the risk of ovarian cancer. In a relatively large case-control study, no indication could be found for an association between postmenopausal HT and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer, even with long-term treatment.1080 Another case-control study reported a slightly increased risk, but it was not statistically significant.1081 And another case-control study could find no increase in risk with ever use, past use, or long duration of use (and no differences comparing various estrogens and regimens).1082 In a comparison of users and nonusers of HT in the state of Washington, the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer was increased among current and recent users of estrogen only, but not in past users or in users of estrogen-progestin.1083

The canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI reported an increase in ovarian cancer that was not statistically significant (HR \= 1.58; CI \= 0.77-3.24), prompting this statement: “The possibility of an increased risk of ovarian cancer incidence and mortality remains worrisome and needs confirmation.”1066 The Kaplan-Meier curves suggested an increasing effect over time, but this, too, was not statistically significant. There were no differences reported in histologic type, stage, or grade (but the small numbers made it essentially impossible to assess subcategories).

All of the studies found it difficult to control for most of the factors that influence the risk of ovarian cancer. This is because there are multiple factors, and information regarding each factor is not readily available.

**Factors that decrease the risk of ovarian cancer**

* Use of steroid hormone contraceptives

* Pregnancy and parity; a greater effect with a recent pregnancy and pregnancy at older age1084,1085

* Breastfeeding1086

* Hysterectomy and tubal ligation1087

* Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)1088

**Factors that increase the risk of ovarian cancer**

* Increasing BMI1089,1090

* Infertility1091

* Family history of ovarian and breast cancer1074

**Mixed reports on risk**

* Alcohol intake1092,1093

* Cigarette smoking1094-1096

Because of the many factors that influence the risk of ovarian cancer, case-control and cohort studies have found it difficult (in fact, impossible) to match cases and controls. Hormone users usually have used more oral contraceptives, have had fewer children, and are more educated and thinner. Adjustments  have  been  made  only  for  major  factors,  such  as  oral

contraceptive use. The technique of meta-analysis is especially hampered by these confounding issues.

A major problem has been the impact of endometrioid cancers, an ovarian cancer that logically can be expected to be influenced by ET. In many of the studies, the overall results are swayed by the increase in endometrioid cancers, a cancer that could originate in hormonally stimulated endometriosis.1097 An accurate analysis requires a separate consideration of endometrioid cancers, but this is difficult because the small numbers do not allow effective subcategorization.

An Australian case-control study reported a statistically significant increase only in the 18 cases with endometrioid cancer.1098 A Swedish case-control study reported a small but significant increase in risk with unopposed estrogen and with sequential estrogen-progestin, but 49% of the cases were endometrioid cancers.1076 In a cohort report from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, only endometrioid cancer was significantly increased.1070 In the WHI, there were two endometrioid cancers in the treated group and none in the placebo group.

It should also be noted that in one randomized trial, a case-control study, and two retrospective cohort analyses, no detrimental effect on prognosis after surgery for ovarian cancer could be detected in patients subsequently treated with hormones.1099-1102 A nested case-control study of postmenopausal hormone-using women in the WHI-OS had examined for a relationship between circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites at study baseline in relation to incident ovarian and endometrial cancers (serous and nonserous types).1103 Fifteen estrogens and estrogen metabolites were quantified in baseline blood samples utilizing stable isotope dilution liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). There was no evidence of a relationship between circulating estrogens nor estrogen metabolites with overall risk for ovarian cancer nor with serous ovarian or endometrial cancers. Interestingly, however, unconjugated estradiol levels were positively associated with nonserous ovarian cancer risk; the likelihood for nonserous ovarian cancer was 3-fold higher in women with unconjugated estradiol levels in the fifth quintile versus those with levels in the first quintile (OR 3.01, 95% CI \= 1.17-7.73). This work offers insights into a heterogeneous endocrine milieu of hormone users and allows novel

insights into etiologic heterogeneity across histologic subtypes of ovarian cancer.

**Overall, there is an indication that ever users of HT, no matter what formulation, progestin, or treatment regimen, have a small increase in the risk of epithelial ovarian cancers. The data are consistent with a promotional effect on existing malignancies because the risk diminishes after discontinuation of treatment. It is not difficult to review the epidemiologic data and conclude that there is no uniform story, that there are studies with both positive and negative results, and that most of the studies struggled with limited power because of small numbers and all of the studies are affected with confounding because of the difficulties in assessing and controlling for risk factors. The case-control and cohort studies inconsistently controlled for level of education, parity, oral contraceptive use, BMI, tubal ligation, and family history of ovarian and breast cancer** (**not a single study controlled for all the known risk factors\!**)**. It is a real possibility that there exists an increased risk for the hormonally sensitive ovarian cancer of the endometrioid type, and studies should carefully segregate this cancer for separate analysis. It is appropriate to emphasize the weak associations and the mixed story, but at the same time, the seriousness of the specific relationship dictates that the association between postmenopausal HT and the risk of ovarian cancer remains an unresolved issue.**

### **COLORECTAL CANCER**

Several observational studies show a reduced risk of colorectal cancer in those taking HT.1104-1113 The effect is greatest in current users, and most studies have not indicated an increased effect with increasing duration of use; for example, the Nurses’ Health Study (which found a 34% reduced risk in current users) could not demonstrate an added benefit with longer duration of hormone use.1114 A reduction in fatal colon cancer has also been documented in current users.1107,1115 In addition, there appears to be a reduced risk of polyps, especially large polyps, among current and recent

hormone users. A reduced risk of colorectal cancer has also been reported with a high intake of phytoestrogens.488,1116

The canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI reported a statistically significant 44% reduction in incidence of colorectal cancer, and this was achieved within only a few years of estrogen-progestin therapy.622 This result in the estrogen-progestin arm was not without concern, however, in that the hormone-treated group had more advanced disease. Indeed, the conclusion was largely because of a difference in localized disease, 10 cases in the treated group and 36 in the placebo group. The results suggest that already-present cancers were influenced by HT to reach a more advanced stage, but that estrogen-progestin treatment reduced the risk of new colonic cancers. Unlike the combination regimen arm of WHI, there was no significant difference in the occurrence of colorectal cancer among hormone users or placebo group in the estrogen-alone WHI trial.1117 However, it must be appreciated that the E-alone WHI trial had two important problems when contrasted with the E+P trial: a very high drop-out rate and about 6,000 fewer participants. Furthermore, interpretability of WHI results must be confined to older postmenopausal women, an age group where carcinogenetic events are likely already underway. Analysis of the California Teacher study for risk of invasive colon cancer also revealed a decreased risk in postmenopausal women taking HT.1118 In another case-control study, both oral and transdermal HTs reduced the risk for developing colorectal cancer.1119

While the mechanisms underlying decreased colorectal cancer risk in HT users remain unclear, a few hypotheses have been put forth. The estrogen-induced change in the bile (a decrease in bile acids with an increase in cholesterol saturation) favors gallstone formation but may reduce the promotion (by bile acids) of colonic cancer. Other possible mechanisms include a direct suppressive effect of hormones on mucosal cell growth and an effect on beneficial mucosal secretions. The colon contains only ER-β, and the reduction in the risk of colonic cancer associated with postmenopausal ET may reflect an antiproliferative activity of the ER-β. Obesity is a recognized risk for colorectal cancer, and body mass has also been suggested as an effect modifier in the relationship between HT and colon cancer.1120 **Despite a lack of clarity on the exact mechanisms whereby HT may confer risk mitigation against colon**

**cancer, this potential for benefit deserves greater attention; colorectal cancer ranks third in women, both in incidence and mortality, and is more prevalent than cancers of the uterus or ovary.**824 **However, it should be noted that data supporting benefits of HT against colon cancer are not uniform, and until clarity is attained, there is no place for use of HT for the prevention of colon cancer.**

### **LUNG CANCER**

The leading cause of cancer mortality in American men and women is lung cancer; 87% of the deaths occur in smokers, and there are twice as many deaths from lung cancer in women as with breast cancer, annually.824 In a post hoc analysis that combined data from 0 to 4 years of follow-up with the treatment period in the canceled estrogen-progestin arm of the WHI, the incidence of non-small cell lung cancer, the type that accounts for about 80% of cases of lung cancer, was nonsignificantly increased, but the number of deaths and the number of poorly differentiated and metastatic tumors were increased in the treatment group.1121 The cases were essentially limited to past and current smokers and to women over age 60\. Although the WHI was not designed to assess lung cancer, and chest imaging was not part of the study protocol, the results are provocative and concerning.

There is reason to believe lung cancer might be a target tissue for estrogen; at the same time, there is evidence to indicate that the impact is not uniformly detrimental and may even be protective. ERs are present in normal and non-small cell lung cells.1122 Case-control studies have indicated a decrease in risk for lung cancer and specifically for non-small cell tumors.1123-1127 Two studies even reported a protective effect in hormone users against lung cancer, especially in smokers.1128,1129 One study reported decreased survival in women with lung cancer who used HT,1130 but others did not detect a decreased survival in patients with lung cancer with a history of HT.1131,1132 The Nurses’ Health Study found an increase in lung cancer mortality in women who underwent early bilateral oophorectomy and did *not* use estrogen.803 Gene expression is stimulated in non-small cell lung cancer cells by estrogen, and proliferation of these cells is reduced by an estrogen antagonist.1133,1134 In the Rancho Bernardo cohort study, there

was no significant association between hormone use and lung cancer; however, there was a suggestion that women over age 55 had a small nonsignificant increase in lung cancer; no such increase was noted in younger women using hormones (although not statistically significant, the results with stratification by age are similar to the WHI findings).1135 **The overall data, including the WHI analysis, suggest that HT initiated in older women with a history of smoking may promote the growth of existing lung cancers. The WHI evidence in women under the age of 60 is reassuring, and case-control and cohort data that reflect hormone use in a younger population than in the WHI indicate that estrogen is associated with some protection against lung cancer.**

### **CERVICAL CANCER**

Any association between postmenopausal HT and cancer of the uterine cervix has not been extensively studied. Evidence from one cohort study and one case-control study is reassuring and indicates that the postmenopausal use of estrogen does not increase the risk of cervical cancer.1136,1137 Indeed, these studies observed protection against cervical cancer in the estrogen users, but this may reflect detection bias (more examinations and Pap smears in estrogen users). Another case-control study suggested an increased risk in cervical adenocarcinomas, but there were only 13 cases.1138 In a follow-up report of 120 women treated for stage I and II cervical cancers, no associations with HT as regard to survival or recurrence were observed.1139

### **MALIGNANT MELANOMA**

The possibility of a relationship between exogenous hormones and cutaneous malignant melanoma has been the subject of many observational studies. Accurate evaluation utilizing the Royal College of General Practitioners and Oxford Family Planning Association prospective cohorts and accounting for exposure to sunlight did not indicate a significant difference in the risk of melanoma comparing users of oral contraceptives

to nonusers.1140,1141 Results with the use of postmenopausal ET have not indicated a major impact. A slightly increased risk with long-term use of estrogen was noted in one case-control study (a conclusion based on 10-20 cases and not achieving statistical significance), whereas other case-control studies could find no association with postmenopausal estrogen treatment.1142-1146 Others have reported slight increases in the risk of malignant melanoma associated with the use of exogenous estrogen, but all failed to reach statistical significance.1136,1142,1147 In an analysis of cancer incidence in a Swedish cohort of women prescribed menopausal HT, no increase in malignant melanoma was observed.874 On the adverse side, a Dutch case-control study reported a significant 42% increase in melanoma risk in postmenopausal hormone users, but it was based on only 33 cases and there was no consideration of sun exposure.1148 In post hoc analyses of the two WHI trials, HT did not affect the incidence of melanoma.540 More recently, associations between the use of oral contraceptives and menopausal HT and melanoma risk were examined in women participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC), a prospective cohort study in 10 participating European countries initiated in 1992\. Among postmenopausal women, ever use of HT was not associated with melanoma risk (HR \= 1.14, 95% CI \= 0.97-1.43).1147 **At this time, no solid evidence exists to suggest an increase in risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma with the use of HT.**

### **METABOLIC EFFECTS**

Severe hypertriglyceridemia and pancreatitis can be precipitated by the administration of oral estrogen to women with elevated triglyceride levels.1149,1150 In women with triglyceride levels between 250 and 500 mg/dL, estrogen should be provided with great caution, and a nonoral route of administration is strongly advised in those being considered for HT. **The triglyceride response to estrogen is rapid, and a repeat level should be obtained in 2 to 4 weeks. If levels are substantially increased, HT must be discontinued. A level greater than 500 mg/dL represents an absolute contraindication to estrogen treatment.** Triglyceride levels in the normal range were not affected by progestins in the PEPI trial.111 An exaggerated

triglyceride response to estrogen might be attenuated by a progestin, especially a progestin of the 19-nortestosterone family, and, therefore, the daily, combination method of treatment could be considered for women with slightly elevated triglycerides. **However, the treatment of choice is transdermal estrogen, a route of administration that does not affect triglyceride levels; indeed, triglyceride levels markedly elevated in response to oral therapy return to normal when the route of administration is changed to transdermal administration.**48,51

Although physiologic and epidemiologic evidence indicates that estrogen use increases the risk of gallbladder disease, the overall impact is not great. The Nurses’ Health Study indicated that oral ET may carry a 1.5-to 2.0-fold increased risk of gallbladder disease.1151 The risk of cholecystectomy appeared to increase with dose and duration of use and to persist for 5 years or more after stopping treatment. Other observational studies also reported increased risks of cholecystectomy in past and current users of estrogen.782,1152,1153 At least two case-control studies concluded that estrogen use is not a risk factor for gallstone disease in postmenopausal women, although the statistical power was limited by small numbers.1154,1155 A cross-sectional study of gallstone disease could detect no association with postmenopausal hormone treatment.1156 In the HERS clinical trial, the RR of gallbladder disease was 1.38; however, this did not achieve statistical significance.780,1157 The risk of gallbladder disease and gallbladder surgery was significantly increased in both the estrogen-progestin and estrogen-only WHI hormone trials.1158 This amounted to an increase of 20 to 30 cases per 10,000 per year in this older population of postmenopausal women. The routine, periodic use of blood chemistries is not cost-effective, and careful monitoring for the appearance of the symptoms and signs of biliary tract disease suffices. It is not certain that this potential problem is limited to oral therapy. Nonoral routes of estrogen administration have been reported to inconsistently increase biliary cholesterol saturation (a lithogenic response).1159,1160 In the Million Women Study in the United Kingdom, the risk of gallbladder disease was actually lower with transdermal estrogen compared with oral estrogen, but the many problems with this observational cohort make it difficult to allow a confident statement.1161

**Weight Gain**

Weight gain in midlife is common, and lifestyle remains the dominant contributor to this occurrence; specifically, the balance of dietary intake and exercise is tilted toward excessive caloric intake because of a decline in physical fitness and the age-related decrease in basal metabolic rate. Despite common perception, the weight gain in women around menopause is not due to the hormonal changes associated with menopause.1160-1164 Likewise, postmenopausal HT cannot be blamed for weight gain. The large Rancho Bernardo prospective cohort study and the randomized PEPI clinical trial documented that HT with or without progestin does not cause an increase in body weight.1165,1166 In fact, in the PEPI trial, the hormone-treated groups actually gained less weight than the placebo group. In the 2-year clinical HOPE trial assessing the efficacy of lower estrogen-progestin doses, hormonal treatment was associated with lesser increases in body weight and body fat compared with placebo.1167

After menopause, there is an increase in abdominal fat and total body fat that is associated with an increase in insulin resistance, a consequence of the decrease in estrogen levels.1168 Postmenopausal ET maintains the premenopausal body habitus, preventing the increases in abdominal fat, insulin resistance, blood pressure, and diabetes mellitus associated with estrogen deficiency.1169 Estrogen (with or without progestin) prevents the tendency to increase central body fat with aging.618-621,1170 This would inhibit the interaction among abdominal adiposity, hormones, insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, blood pressure, and an atherogenic lipid profile that results in the metabolic syndrome. An excellent randomized trial in Denmark documented less weight gain with HT because of a smaller increase in fat mass.1171 In a substudy of the WHI, assessments of body composition by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) indicated that estrogen-progestin users had less fat and greater lean mass.1172 This same salutary effect on central body fat has also been observed with tibolone treatment.1173 **Rather than causing body weight gain, therefore, postmenopausal HT reduces the increase in insulin resistance and abdominal fat usually seen with aging, with a beneficial impact on the risks of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and dyslipidemia.**

### **PRESENTATIONS REQUIRING CLINICAL JUDGMENT**

**Patients With Endometrial Cancer, Endometrioid Tumors, and Endometriosis**

Gynecologic oncologists have reported that HT can be safely considered in patients who have had stage I and II adenocarcinoma of the endometrium without fear of an increased risk of recurrence or a decrease in disease-free interval.1174-1177 In a matched cohort of 249 women with stage I, II, and III endometrial cancers with a long follow-up, there was no indication of an increase in recurrent disease with HT.1178 Similar negative results were reported in a Turkish case-control study.1179 The only randomized trial, organized by the Gynecologic Oncology Group, closed prematurely because of recruitment difficulties following the publicity associated with the WHI.1180 Nevertheless, a total of 1,236 patients with stage I or II endometrial cancer were randomized to either estrogen-only or placebo, and although the participants constituted a low-risk group, the recurrence rate was low, 14 recurrences with 5 deaths in the treatment group and 12 recurrences and 9 deaths in the placebo group. If a high-risk tumor is ER and PR negative, it seems reasonable to allow immediate initiation of HT. Because the latent period with endometrial cancer is relatively short, a period of time under observation (5 years) without evidence of recurrence would increase the likelihood of long-term safety on an estrogen program. **We recommend that HT be avoided in patients with high-risk tumors that are receptor-positive until 5 years have elapsed. The combination of estrogen-progestin is recommended in view of the potential protective action of the progestational agent. A similar approach makes sense for patients previously treated for endometrioid tumors of the ovary. In view of the fact that adenocarcinoma has been reported in patients with pelvic endometriosis and on unopposed estrogen and that estrogen alone may allow for recurrence of endometriosis, the combined estrogen-progestin program is also advised in patients with a prior history of endometriosis.**1181-1186

**Should a Postmenopausal Woman Who Has Had Breast Cancer Use Hormones?**

The argument that postmenopausal HT should not be given to women who have had breast cancer is a reasonable one. It is based on the recognition of a large body of evidence that indicates that breast cancer is often a hormone-responsive tumor. The overriding fear of many clinicians (and patients) is that metastatic cells are present (perhaps being controlled by various host defense factors) that will be susceptible to stimulation by exogenous hormones.1187 However, many women who have had breast cancer are aware of the benefits of postmenopausal hormone treatment and are asking clinicians to help make this risk-benefit decision. In addition, some women suffer from such severe hot flushing and vaginal dryness that they are willing to consider hormonal treatment. Tibolone treatment of breast cancer survivors is relatively contraindicated as discussed earlier in this chapter.

The rate of recurrent breast cancer in hormone users has been reported in multiple case series with more than 1,000 breast cancer survivors.1188-1204 It is reassuring that the recurrence rates in these reports are not different from the expected rate of breast cancer recurrence. In one series, 25 and then 77 women with breast cancer ranging from in situ to stage III disease received estrogen-progestin therapy for 24 to 82 months; the recurrence rate was not greater than that expected.1191,1192 From this group of patients,

41 breast cancer survivors receiving HT had the same outcomes when compared with 82 women selected from a cancer registry and not taking hormones.1192 In a report from Australia, 90 women with a history of breast cancer who were given a combination of estrogen and progestin had lower mortality and recurrence rates; however, the dose of progestin was very high (which in itself can be therapeutic), and treatment was not randomized.1196 In a follow-up of 319 women treated with estrogen after treatment for localized breast cancer, only one patient developed recurrent disease.1197 In a matched-controlled series of 277 breast cancer survivors, there was no difference in the estrogen-treated group and the control group for recurrent disease.1204 A series with 114 women who received hormone treatment had a low rate of recurrence.1193 These patients have had both positive and negative nodes and positive and negative ER status. Although the results conform to an incidence of recurrent disease no greater than expected, the outcomes can reflect biases in clinician and patient decision-

making that can only be overcome with a proper long-term, randomized clinical trial.

A case-control study of HT after breast cancer actually found a significant reduction in risk of recurrent disease, breast cancer mortality, and total mortality in hormone users.1205 Again, these are reassuring observational data that HT after breast cancer has no adverse impact on recurrence.

A US trial at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center provided estrogen to randomized women who had been treated for localized stage I and stage II breast cancers with either ER-negative or ER status unknown tumors.1206 After 5 years of follow-up, 56 women in the trial receiving estrogen were compared with 243 women with comparable disease not receiving estrogen; there was no adverse effect of estrogen treatment on disease-free survival.1207

A multicenter, large case-control study of women younger than 55 years with breast cancer concluded that the use of oral contraceptives or postmenopausal HT either before or after diagnosis did not increase the risk of the first breast cancer or recurrent breast cancer.1208 This negative finding was not changed by duration of use or age of oral contraceptive use or by BMI, duration of use, or type of postmenopausal hormone use (estrogen only or combined estrogen-progestin).

A longitudinal national cohort study analyzed over 2,000 women with a history of early-stage invasive ER-positive breast cancer taking either vaginal estrogen or systemic HT. Neither vaginal nor systemic HT was associated with increased risk of recurrence or mortality.1209 An increase in recurrence was, however, noted on subgroup analysis of vaginal hormone users who were also on an AI (HR \= 1.39, 95% CI \= 1.04-1.85); mortality risk was not increased, and these authors advised caution when considering vaginal ET for early-stage breast cancer patients who are on AIs as adjuvant therapy.

***The HABITS Trial***

“Hormonal replacement therapy After Breast cancer—Is it Safe?” (HABITS) began in multiple centers in Sweden in May 1997, to compare breast cancer survivors treated for at least 2 years with HT with treatment other than hormones. A similar trial was initiated in Stockholm. Because

recruitment was slower than anticipated, the two trials agreed in February 2002 to pool their patients and to use a joint safety and monitoring committee. In October 2003, the safety committee recommended that the trial be discontinued because there were 26 women in the treated group with new breast cancers compared with 7 in the nontreated group. The HABITS trial was terminated in December 2003\.1210 Confronted with this outcome, the Stockholm investigators decided to cancel their trial as well, even though the HR in the Stockholm patients was 0.82 (CI \= 0.35-1.9).

HABITS was a randomized but not placebo-controlled trial in which HT was compared to management without hormones in women with menopausal symptoms who had been previously treated for stage I or II breast cancer. Concomitant use of tamoxifen treatment was allowed in the HABITS patients, but not of AIs. HT consisted of the variety of products and methods on the Swedish market, but not tibolone. Most of the treated women used products with the relatively high dose of 2 mg estradiol. After 4 more years of follow-up of 442 women, there were 39 cases of new breast cancer in women using HT compared with 17 in the nontreated group, for an HR of 2.4 (CI \= 1.3-4.2).1211

It is important to appreciate some significant concerns related to the study design and methodology in HABITS. The treated and nontreated groups of women were very different in terms of characteristics and behaviors. More of the women in the treated group had hormone receptor-positive cancers (62.3%) compared with the nontreated group (54.5%). Protocol deviations occurred; 11 women in the treated group never received hormones, whereas 43 in the nontreated group did receive hormones. There was a very wide range of exposure times, ranging from 0 to 80 months. About one-third of the women who received hormones changed products during the study. The method of analysis of the HABITS data was intent to treat and, thus, the impact of these differences cannot be ascertained.

Analysis of the new breast cancers in HABITS (either local recurrences or contralateral cancers) indicated statistically significant increases only in hormone receptor-positive cancers. However, when adjusted for use of HT before diagnosis of the original breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, and hormone receptor status, the HR was 2.2 with a CI that included 1 (1.0-5.1), which, by definition, while close, is not statistically significant.

The Stockholm trial reported in 2005, after a median follow-up of 4.1 years, 11 new breast cancers in the treated arm and 13 new breast cancers in the nontreated arm.1212 Why there is difference between the Stockholm trial and HABITS? The HABITS investigators suggest that their patients had more node-positive disease and thus “probably” had more women with subclinical disease that would be stimulated by HT. Another possibility was more protection with higher tamoxifen use in the Stockholm trial, although the HABITS trial could detect no impact of tamoxifen. The HABITS investigators believe that another possible explanation was the greater use of norethindrone and NETA in HABITS compared with the use of MPA in Stockholm. All of these explanations are speculations; the difference between the two trials remains and calls into question the reliability and accuracy of the data.

The cancelation of HABITS and the Stockholm trials made it impossible for the English and Italian trials to continue recruitment, and they were also canceled. Thus, the scientific community was left with many questions, but without ongoing efforts to elucidate answers. In our view, the existing data on the risk of breast cancer recurrence or new-onset cancers related to HT are far from being definitive.

**Although intuitively it seems that the risk/benefit ratio would be more favorable in the presence of negative nodes, negative receptors, and small tumors, are negative ER and PR assessments by themselves sufficient to conclude that the cancer is not sensitive to hormones? Moreover, if the patient is in the high-cure category, does it make any difference what the receptor status is? The answers to these questions are not known. Receptor status is not absolute; it is always a relative measure and can change over the course of disease progression.**

**Patients and clinicians have to incorporate all of the previously mentioned considerations into medical decision-making. However, when all is said and done, patients have to take an unknown risk if they want the benefits of hormone treatment; the prescribing clinicians too take an unknown medical-legal risk. Some patients who are burdened by severe menopausal symptoms that remain unresponsive to nonhormonal interventions may and do choose to take estrogen, judging the benefits to their quality of life with hormone use to be worth the unknown risk. Until definitive data are available from**

**clinical trials, clinicians should support patients in this decision. Other patients will prefer to avoid any unknown risks. These patients, too, deserve support in their decision.**

### **IMPLICATIONS OF HORMONE THERAPY FOR WOMEN WITH DIABETES MELLITUS**

Estrogen can improve the metabolic changes associated with diabetes. Indeed, in prospective studies of postmenopausal women with type 2, non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, estrogen-only or estrogen-progestin therapy improved all glucose metabolic parameters, including insulin resistance, the lipoprotein profile, and measurements of androgenicity.631,632,1066,1213-1217 One study, however, could detect no impact with transdermal administration.1215 These changes should reduce the risk of CVD, and in a very large cohort of 24,420 women from the Northern California Kaiser Permanente Diabetes Registry, current use of HT reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, but in women with a recent heart attack, an increased risk of a recurrent myocardial infarction was observed in hormone users (again a difference between primary prevention and secondary prevention).1218 Tibolone also has a beneficial impact in short-term studies on insulin resistance in normal women and in women with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.283,307 Raloxifene, an SERM, has no effects on glucose metabolism or insulin sensitivity in normal women but exerts a modest improvement in insulin resistance in women who are hyperinsulinemic.1219,1220
